morning and thank you for joining us.', 'On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stephen Williamson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please note this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investors section of our website, thermofisher.com, under the heading News and Events until August 12, 2022. A copy of the press release of our second quarter 2022 earnings is available in the Investors section of our website under the heading, Financials.', 'So before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement. Various remarks that we may make about the company’s future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company’s most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, which are on file with the SEC and available in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financials, SEC filings.', 'While we may like to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so even if our estimates change. Therefore, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to today. Also during this call, we will be referring to certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the press release of our second quarter 2022 earnings and also in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financials.', 'So with that, I will now turn the call over to Marc.', 'Thank you, Stephen. Operator, we’re ready for Q&A.', 'Great. Thanks Puneet. Operator, we will take one more question.', 'Thank you, Raf. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today for our second quarter call.', 'As you saw in our press release, we had another excellent quarter. We delivered outstanding financial performance.', 'Our core business is performing very well, that strength is broad-based across all our businesses.', 'As I reflect on the quarter, I am very proud of the team’s great execution and the resulting share gain we saw across our business.', 'Our ongoing success is propelled by our proven growth strategy and our PPI Business System, which is a differentiator for us and enables operational excellence within the company.', 'You will see this in our second quarter results and increased outlook for the year.', 'So, let me first recap the financials.', 'Our revenue in the quarter grew 18% year-over-year to $10.97 billion.', 'Our adjusted operating income was $2.61 billion.', 'Our adjusted operating margin in the second quarter was 23.7% and we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS performance, achieving $5.51 per share.', 'Let me now give you some color on our performance by end market. Starting with pharma and biotech, we had excellent performance in this end market, delivering growth in the mid-teens. We saw excellent growth across all businesses serving these customers, highlighted by our bioproduction and pharma services businesses.', 'We are continuing to benefit from our trusted partner status that we have earned over many years with our pharma and biotech customers. In academic and government, we grew in the mid single-digits in the quarter. We saw strong growth in biosciences and chromatography and mass spectrometry.', 'Turning to industrial and applied, we grew in the low double-digits for the quarter. We saw very strong growth in electron microscopy, chromatography and mass spectrometry and our research and safety market channel.', 'Finally, in diagnostics and healthcare, revenue was 20% lower than the prior year quarter. In this end market, the core business saw strong growth led by immunodiagnostics and microbiology.', 'During the quarter, the team continued to execute well to support customers’ COVID-19 testing needs. Overall, excellent performance across our end markets. And as I reflect on this quarter’s performance, we continue to deliver very differentiated core business growth. This was driven by three factors: the market conditions were good; our team managed lockdowns in China extremely well; and we had outstanding execution from our global team, resulting in meaningful share gain.', 'Let me now provide an update on the progress we made in executing our proven growth strategy. The investments we have made and are continuing to make across the company are fueling growth and generating strong returns.', 'Our growth strategy has enabled another quarter of excellent performance.', 'As a reminder, our strategy consists of three pillars: developing high-impact innovative new products; leveraging our scale in the high growth and emerging markets; and delivering a unique value proposition to our customers. I will start with innovation. We launched a number of new products across our businesses to further strengthen our industry leadership and enable our customers to accelerate scientific breakthroughs. I will highlight a few of these.', 'We have an outstanding American Society for Mass Spectrometry Conference, where we showcased new instruments, consumables and software to advance our customers’ work. These included the Thermo Scientific AccelerOme automated sample prep platform, which simplifies workflows for proteomic researchers by eliminating a range of previously manual steps.', 'We also launched the cloud-based Thermo Scientific RDO software platform, which integrates functionality and data across multiple chromatography and mass spectrometry instruments to simplify application-specific workflows, helping scientists share information with each other and labs around the world and speeding the development of new diagnostics and therapies.', 'In addition, we launched the Thermo Scientific Direct Mass Technology mode for our industry-leading Q Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometers. This technology allows for the characterization of complex and large biotherapeutics, which were previously challenging to interpret. In our biosciences business, we launched the Gibco CTS TrueCut Cas9 Protein that supports genome editing for applications such as CAR-T cell therapy research. Emerging therapies like CAR-T are providing new hope in treating cancer. And in Specialty Diagnostics, we launched the Phadia 2500+ series in the U.S., a high-throughput instrument for allergy and autoimmune diagnostics to help further improve lab efficiency. These new products and many others will make a significant difference for our customers and drive future growth for our company.', 'Turning to our high growth and emerging markets, we are really thrilled with our team’s progress.', 'You may remember that we called out China as a potential Q2 headwind, because of the COVID-19 lockdowns in the country. Obviously, the lockdowns were very severe, but I am so proud of the way the team responded. They powered through demonstrating the relevance of our offering amid the crisis and delivered over 20% growth. That was the result of a very strong core business, the benefit of deep relationships we have with our customers, and our support for local COVID-19 testing.', 'So overall, it was a great quarter and one that clearly demonstrates our growth strategy continues to deliver outstanding results.', 'The third pillar of our growth strategy is our unique customer value proposition.', 'Our capabilities enable our customers’ ability to achieve their own goals for innovation and productivity. To be the best partner for our customers, we continue to enhance our capacity and capabilities.', 'Let me share a couple of examples. In our flagship facility for cell culture media in Grand Island, New York, we just completed a capacity expansion to support customers’ research, drug development and production applications. And in our lab chemicals business in Geel, Belgium, where we have our primary Continental European distribution center for lab chemicals, we just completed a major expansion of the facility to support the strong growth that we have been delivering. I have had the opportunity to visit both sides a number of times and it’s really exciting to see the ongoing strength in customer demand that’s driving the need for this investment. These are just a few reflections on the way we are supporting our customers by further strengthening our capabilities and value proposition.', 'Now, turning to capital deployment, I’d like to share some of the other steps we have taken to further strengthen our customer value proposition and build our future.', 'We continue to successfully execute our disciplined capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders.', 'We are very pleased with the performance of the PPD acquisition. The business is performing very well, delivering strong core revenue and earnings growth. In May, at our Investor Day, we increased the revenue synergy outlook by $100 million to $250 million in year 3 and the cost synergies in that year by $25 million to $100 million and the synergy opportunities continue to be incredibly exciting. I just had a chance to meet with the clinical research commercial organization and I am so impressed with the team and the opportunity that they see for enabling the success of our customers going forward. The combination of capabilities is really resonating with customers and we are seeing strong momentum in the business.', 'All of this is leading to business performance well ahead of the deal market. The acquisition of PPD is another example of how our capital deployment strategy is creating customer and shareholder value.', 'Turning now to an update to our ESG initiatives, we released our latest Corporate Social Responsibility Report. This report details our progress and disclosures for all of our key ESG initiatives and is a great example of how we are continually working to enhance our reporting and disclosure using internationally recognized reporting standards. It’s great to see the progress detailed in the report and also reflecting the progress we have made through our commitment to ESG over many years.', 'For this quarter, I will highlight the progress we continue to make on our goal to reduce our carbon footprint.', 'As part of our efforts, we continue to transition to renewable energy is sold at onsite rooftop solar power at key locations to reduce our consumption of electricity produced with fossil fuels.', 'We are also working with our suppliers on their climate performance goals which will ultimately have an impact across our value chain.', 'As a leader in ESG, our commitment to progress is ingrained in everything we do and we look forward to updating you on our progress as we go forward.', 'Now, I’d like to review our updated 2022 guidance at a high level and then Steve will take you through the details.', 'We are meaningfully raising our full year guidance.', 'We are increasing our revenue guidance by $700 million to $43.15 billion, which would result in 10% reported revenue growth over 2021 and we are raising our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.28 to $22.93 per share. This higher outlook primarily reflects the strength of our core business and additional contribution of COVID-19 testing revenue, which are more than offsetting the increased foreign exchange headwinds, demonstrating how well we operate with speed and scale to enable our customer success and navigate dynamic macro environments.', 'So, to summarize our key takeaways from the second quarter.', 'Our outstanding results in Q2 highlight the benefits of our proven growth strategy, our PPI business system and our extraordinary team.', 'Our business is performing very well and we are gaining market share. The PPD acquisition is generating strong returns.', 'We are really well positioned to continue to differentiate ourselves for all of our stakeholders. And the team is doing an excellent job navigating the dynamic times we are living in.', 'All of this has enabled to raise our outlook for 2022 and further solidify our incredibly bright future. With that, I will now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?', 'Hi, Jack. Good morning.', 'So Jack, I guess the first thing is business performing extraordinarily well, right? We have broad-based strength.', 'As I look at the companies that have reported, we’ve done very well from a top line perspective.', 'So I feel good about how we’re performing. Bookings performance was very good.', 'So if I think about what are we seeing in our business, we’re seeing very strong strength, right? In terms of the macro, obviously, when you read the papers or wherever information source, lots and lots of challenges in the world. And in the last quarter, we articulated some of them and how we factored some of that into the thinking for our outlook.', 'And so what do we think about sensitivity? This company is incredibly well positioned to navigate whatever the world throws at us, right? And the industry in and of itself is attractive as well as sensitive economically than many.', 'We are very well positioned within it, and we have tremendous momentum. When I think about – if we see a downturn, and we’re not seeing the signs of one, but it doesn’t mean that there won’t be one.', 'We have the benefit of a track record of dynamic of navigating dynamic times and exiting those periods really an incredibly strong industry leader. We benefit from an experienced management team, an incredible team around the world, a proven growth strategy in a PPI business system, which gives us great operational discipline.', 'As you know, we’ve taken a number of actions over the last few years to strengthen our position in the end markets we serve. And today, relative to the recession and the great financial crisis, we have less industrial exposure.', 'As a reminder, about 30% of our revenue going into the last recession was industrial. Today, it’s about 13%. And Pharma and Biotech is much larger, and that has been the least economically sensitive of the end markets, and that represents just under 60% of our revenue. And when I think about our mix, we’re more service and consumables oriented than we were then. Then, it was 65% of our revenue. Today, it’s 82% of our revenue.', 'So the company is performing well.', 'Our end markets are good, and we will manage through whatever the world throws at us. And you see that in the results, right? You see that in the – FX got meaningfully more challenging for all global companies, and we’re able to power through that and deliver an increase in our guidance.', 'So from a capital deployment perspective, I really wanted to do the deeper dive on the progress of PPD, and we did a large acquisition in December, right? And the first thing we have to demonstrate is that we’re great owners and operators of the businesses that are part of the family, and that’s always our number one priority, and that business has performed great. And we have an active pipeline. And when I think about how valuations have come in many sectors that creates opportunities, right? So we’re actively engaged as we always are and we’re well positioned to capitalize on the M&A opportunities that will be out there in the landscape.', 'Patrick, good morning, thanks for the questions.', 'So, when I think about bioprocessing, I always like to frame it in the context of how we serve former biotech, right? The market will level up, it’s very attractive.', 'We have a leading presence, and we’re really well positioned to serve those customer base. And you’ve seen us deliver really strong growth. When I think about production, right, or bioproduction, as a reminder, we have two major activities that we have within our company.', 'We have our bioproduction business, which is the leading presence in cell culture media, single-use technologies and a rapidly growing purification resins business as well as our pharma services business, which is both drug substance and drug product for biologics. And you see us play with the monoclonal antibodies, viral vectors, cell therapy, plasmid, sterile fill, finish all part of that.', 'So it’s a large portion of our total presence in serving pharma biotech. Outstanding quarter, right, when I look at – and that was both across the services business and bioproduction. When I look at how others have done and reported, I feel very, very good about our performance. And the outlook here is really positive. When I think about your question on the COVID vaccine therapies, our outlook for the year is $1.5 billion. That’s the same as it was in Q1. We did just over $400 million of revenue in Q2, which was right in line with our expectations. It brings us to a little bit over $900 million at the halfway point of the year.', 'So we feel good about our role in supporting our customers’ activities in vaccines and therapies. That’s part of our core revenue growth.', 'So over time, when there is less demand for those capabilities, we will transition that well to other applications, which we do all the time.', 'I’ll start with the customer comments, and Stephen will go through his thoughts.', 'We’re incredibly transparent with our customers and a partner to enable their success.', 'So we’ve had very constructive discussions, and we’ve operated with transparency and has allowed us to get an appropriate level of pricing.', 'Sure, Mike. Thanks for the question.', 'So when I think about the 13% core growth – the 14% core growth for the first half, really strong momentum in the business and very broad-based, right? So that’s exciting. And when I look at how the industry is reporting, we’re faring very well.', 'So I’m proud of the team’s efforts.', 'So some of the highlights, geographically, the team is doing incredibly good job in China.', 'So that’s one lens. End market lens, pharma biotech going incredibly quickly, right, with mid-teens growth.', 'So that’s another of lens. And then the way you framed it, from the businesses perspective, analytical instruments is doing very well. It’s going to see the 13% growth in the segment, great performance in electron microscopy and chromatography and mass spectrometry.', 'Our channel is performing well, pharma services. And then while it doesn’t it’s in the core.', 'Our PPD acquisition has performed very well. We’ve obviously had the benefit of seeing a couple of industry participants report and that business is going well. And to be candid, it’s pretty much broad-based cost business. I haven’t mentioned either. It’s not the – I didn’t say something to us not doing well. The team is really humming right now.', 'So, Mike, I guess a few thoughts on 2023, right. And obviously, I am looking forward – I am actually doing it every day, it’s not that. But when we get to January, I will be looking forward to giving you the – give you the update on sort of what we think for the year, right, so in the details. What we don’t know now, right. And it’s just nobody knows is what’s the macro environment, right. Is it – was it like the first half of this year, well, phenomenal, right, or is it different, and so we will appropriately set the context for 2023, when we get there. But I think there are a couple of things that are worth saying at this point in time to at least help you think about it. One is the core business, right. It’s going to be large, right.', 'We are growing the business faster this year than we had outlined in the long-term model.', 'So, I mean the jumping off point in 2023 is we are going to have a bigger business. And that’s core that drives earnings power and all of those things.', 'We will have an appropriate growth range based on how we see the world at that point in time.', 'We will figure that out as it gets closer. And then Stephen might – do you want to comment on FX and because I know that the movements have been enormous, and you might want to frame how to think about that for next year. But I feel great about how the core business performed.', 'Yes. And Mike, when I think about the 7% to 9% growth, that’s the long-term sort of average we worked through.', 'So, it can vary in a given year, as this year, obviously, is above that, it can be within and it can be different, just depends on the measure we use is, are we delivering really good performance, right. And it’s going to be in the context of what’s the environment.', 'So, that’s going to wait until January. Thanks for the questions.', 'So – when I think about the business in China, the team really did an excellent job I think really difficult circumstances. They basically had a month in the Shanghai region to basically get the business to really incredible performance in June.', 'So, I am very proud of that. We had good growth in the core business, much better than we expected. And a nice chunk of the overdrive in COVID testing was in supporting the local activities.', 'So, we did a really good job there. We don’t sell our assays there, but we do sell our instruments and in our reagents to support local demand.', 'So, we had strong core growth and a meaningful response in China, actually larger than we typically have in China for COVID testing. The way I think about the outlook is it should be a good market in the second half of the year. I have no doubt there will be some level of COVID disruption. What that will be, when it will be, where it will be, hard to know. But just given the zero COVID policies, there will be bumps on the road. But the team knows how to navigate that, and I feel like we will get through that period effectively. And there could be some headwinds here or there, but nothing that we see at this point in time in China. It looks very strong.', 'So Rachel, thanks for the question. Pharma market has been very strong.', 'One of the questions because as our investors and analysts ask the question. I asked the team about are there patterns, trends, anything that is jumping out. And it’s actually been broad-based strength, right.', 'We are seeing good growth in the various sub-segments within the customer base.', 'So, I feel like the momentum is strong. Orders were strong. There is always company-specific challenges right. There will be companies that have bad data, bad report out or a company that’s going to a cat and whatever [ph]. And we help those companies navigate those times. We help them drive productivity and accelerate innovation, and those things. But we continue to see strong momentum in pharma and biotech. Thanks for the questions.', 'So, Matt, thanks for the question.', 'One of the things that’s just been phenomenal is the speed at which we have been able to get meaningful authorizations that clearly synergy work, meaning the benefits of bringing the combination together and we have had several of the larger clients that have worked historically, very closely with us, already select us to do business with them in clinical research.', 'So, we have had meaningful wins there.', 'We are also seeing some really interesting momentum in some of the smaller companies, well, so it’s not just the large ones. But that concept of leveraging the existing relationships and the trusted partner status is working really well. And I think it was really cool that we were able to increase our synergy outlook by $100 million back in May, really just at that point was just six months after the close. I mean it’s a big number. And the team is not stopping there. They are focused on closing business, building a very large authorizations backlog and growing the business incredibly strongly for the long-term.', 'So, I think it’s very positive. And we have earned a lot of trust over many years, and we are going to help our customers develop their medicines and do that cost effectively and rapidly so that they can really benefit patients.', 'So, it’s a very exciting time in terms of our clinical research momentum.', 'So, Matt, thanks for the question.', 'So, Europe actually had a good quarter, right. And it’s so to say that with down double digits. And effectively, we had a very significant COVID-19 testing comparison.', 'So, embedded under that, the core business grew very strongly, actually.', 'So, the demand has been good, and we saw really good market conditions in bioproduction, the research and safety market channel will be examples business did really well in Europe.', 'So, what I saw in Q2 was strong. There is obviously lots of challenges in Europe. When we put that sentence, it’s not a Thermo Fisher comment or an industry comment with pressures on energy prices and certainly, lots of challenges with the war in Ukraine.', 'I think Europe will clearly be lumpy from a global economy perspective. But given our mix of business, which is very similar to the company average, we have a very large pharma biotech presence in Europe. And when you take out the COVID testing, it represents a little under 20% of our revenue.', 'I think we will navigate that well.', 'Again, in terms of the industrial and Applied, we obviously continue to see good momentum.', 'We have a good position in serving semiconductor materials science. Those are – have been strong. The Applied markets funding has been fine.', 'So, that sector continues to be good. There is obviously global macroeconomic concerns, but generally, things continue to be strong. And we do have a different mix than we were much smaller in terms of the percentage of the total is so a different mix.', 'We have more raw material science mix than we did back in the last recession.', 'Puneet, good morning.', 'So, Puneet, we had very strong performance in the quarter. Bookings were very strong as well.', 'So, that gives us – that’s encouraging in the second half.', 'We also have a very large backlog, right.', 'So, that also gives us some visibility to the second half as well, it gives us the confidence in the very strong outlook we have for the year from a core perspective.', 'So, the signs are very good. And we are launching some amazing technology. That makes a huge difference. Like ASMS this year, I give obviously a deeper dive than normal, really affecting the workflow across a number of key applications for mass spectrometry, fantastic in terms of the feedback and momentum in the business. The same thing is true in our electron microscopy business is very strong.', 'So, I think we are very well positioned going forward there.', 'Puneet, thanks for the question.', 'So, we picked a couple of really specific examples this quarter to highlight. I picked the example of Grand Island and Geel. And those capacity expansions or demand has been so strong for so long that we need to expand our capacity just to be able to support our future growth, right. It’s just – it’s a different type of example, which is you deliver great results year-in, year-out, at some point, you expand your network to facilitate the gross strategy. Other of the expansions have a little more just adding new capabilities. They have been coming online this year and will continue to come online next year.', 'So, it’s a mix. And it’s exciting in terms of in – we have really – we brought on new capacity in our self to finish. That was really the enabling the Moderna relationship expansion outside of COVID and that’s really a 2023 example. And we have a number of other examples like single-use technology that we will be bringing online and we will continue to bring them on.', 'So, it’s a mix, but we feel good about the blend of investments and how they will fuel our growth strategy going forward.', 'So, on the FX and customer impact, the movements have been very rapid and relatively recently.', 'So, there hasn’t been a lot of customer discussion, it’s really about where the rate is going to settle. And it’s also going to depend a lot on what the alternatives are. If everybody is a U.S. based cost company, then it is what it is.', 'If you have different where are we producing, where others producing and get into some of those dynamics.', 'So far, it’s been a non-issue. And we have dealt with this. The fact that I pulled out a playbook from what we had in the years past where we had rapid moves in the rates and we know how to navigate that environment a lot. Steve?', 'So, as you have heard this morning, really an excellent first half of the year.', 'We are on track to deliver another outstanding year with great momentum and that sets us up for a very bright future.', 'As always, thank you for your ongoing support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Thanks everyone.', 'Thanks, Marc and good morning, everyone. We delivered another excellent quarter in Q2. This included 13% core organic revenue growth, $630 million of COVID-19 testing revenue, $5.51 of adjusted earnings per share, and over $1 billion of free cash flow. Revenue in Q2 was $930 million higher than we had incorporated in our previous 2022 guidance, with $640 million driven by ongoing strength in the core business and $400 million from testing, partially offset by $110 million due to higher headwind from foreign exchange. Similar to last quarter, the strength in the core was broad-based across businesses and end markets. From a geographic lens, $200 million of the beat was from China. In our previous guidance, we had assumed a $200 million headwind from the lockdowns in China and we offset all of that, half from strong local core growth and half from local testing support, a great achievement by our China team.', 'Our PPI business system enabled us to generate very strong pull-through on the revenue beat and adjusted EPS for Q2 was $0.52 higher than included in our previous guidance.', 'So Q2 was a continuation of our excellent financial performance track record.', 'Let me now provide you with some more details. Beginning with our earnings results, as I mentioned, we delivered $5.51 of adjusted EPS in Q2 and GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.22.', 'On the top line, our Q2 reported revenue grew 18% year-over-year. The components of our Q2 reported revenue increase included 3% organic revenue growth, a 19% contribution from acquisitions, and a headwind of 4% from foreign exchange.', 'Turning to our organic revenue performance by geography, the organic growth rates by region are skewed by the COVID-19 testing revenue in the current and prior year. In Q2, North America grew in the high single-digits, Europe declined in the low double-digits, Asia-Pacific grew in the low double-digits, with China growing over 20% and rest of world declined low double-digits. With respect to our operational performance, adjusted operating income in the quarter decreased 3% and adjusted operating margin was 23.7%, 530 basis points lower than Q2 last year. Adjusted operating margin was slightly higher than we had anticipated in our prior guidance for Q2, reflecting how our growth strategy and PPI business system enabled us to continue to manage dynamic times. In the quarter, we achieved strong price realization to effectively address inflation while also driving strong productivity and positive volume leverage in the core business. This was more than offset by the expected impact of incorporating PPD into our financials, lower testing volumes and continued strategic investments, including investments in our colleagues.', 'Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 43.2%, 740 basis points lower than Q2 last year.', 'For the second quarter, the change in gross margin was due to the same drivers as those for our adjusted operating margin. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 16.1% of revenue, a decrease of 180 basis points versus Q2 2021. The R&D expense was approximately $360 million in Q2, representing growth of 6% over the prior year quarter.', 'You can see the benefits of our prior R&D investments in our differentiated core organic growth rate and the exciting new products that Marc outlined. Moreover, the continued investments we are making in R&D are helping to fuel an even brighter future.', 'Looking at our results below the line for the quarter, our net interest expense was $112 million, approximately flat to Q2 last year.', 'Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 13%. This was 100 basis points lower than Q2 last year, driven by our tax planning initiatives. Average diluted shares were $394 million in Q2, approximately $2 million lower year-over-year, driven by share repurchases net of option dilution.', 'Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, year-to-date cash flow from continuing operations was $3.7 billion and free cash flow was $2.6 billion.', 'Our capacity and capability investments continue to progress well and our year-to-date net capital expenditures were $1.1 billion. We returned over $115 million to shareholders through dividends in the quarter and this reflects the 15% dividend increase we announced in February. We paid down $1.85 billion of commercial paper in Q2 and ended the quarter with approximately $1.9 billion in cash and $30.3 billion of total debt.', 'Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.3x gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 2.2x on a net debt basis. Concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 16.6%, reflecting the strong returns on investment that we are generating across the company.', 'Now I will provide some color on the performance of our four business segments.', 'Let me start with a couple of framing comments. The scale and margin profile of our COVID-19 testing revenue varies by segment and the testing revenue was significantly higher in the prior year quarter that does skew some of the reported segment margins. And as I mentioned earlier, we are executing strong pricing realization across all segments to address higher inflation. And as we outlined at the beginning of the year, we are referring to our acquired PPD business as our clinical research business and that resides in laboratory products in Biopharma Services segment.', 'So, moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Science Solutions, Q2 reported revenue in this segment declined 7% and organic revenue was 5% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q2, we delivered very strong growth in our bioproduction business. This is offset by lower revenue in the genetic sciences business driven by the moderation in testing revenue versus the year ago quarter. Q2 adjusted operating income in Life Science Solutions decreased 23% and adjusted operating margin was 40.3%, down 800 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity, which is more than offset by unfavorable business mix and the strategic investments we are making across the segment. In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 9% in Q2, and the organic growth was 13%. The strong growth in this segment this quarter was led by electron microscopy and the chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses. Q2 adjusted operating income in this segment increased 23% and adjusted operating margin was 21.4%, up 250 basis points year-over-year.', 'During the quarter, we delivered strong volume flow-through and productivity that was partially offset by strategic investments.', 'Turning to Specialty Diagnostics, in Q2, reported revenue declined 11% and organic revenue was 8% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q2, we saw strong underlying growth in our immunodiagnostics and microbiology businesses, as well as our healthcare market channel. This is offset by lower COVD-19 testing revenue versus the year ago quarter.', 'While Q2 adjusted operating income decreased 1% in the quarter, adjusted operating margin was 22.1%, up 220 basis points from the prior year quarter. In Q2, the impact of lower testing volume was more than offset by strong productivity enabled by our PPI Business System and positive business mix. And finally, in Laboratory Products & Biopharma Services segment. Q2 reported revenue increased 55%. Organic growth was 10% and the impact of acquisitions was 48%.', 'During Q2, we had strong growth in the research and safety market channel and in the Pharma Services and Laboratory Products businesses. PPD, our clinical research business, is performing very well and continues to exceed our expectations.', 'During the quarter, it grew slightly higher than the rest of the segment, contributing $1.72 billion of revenue. Q2 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 55% and adjusted operating margin was 12.5%, which is 10 basis points higher than the prior year quarter. In the quarter, we drove strong productivity and also still the benefit from acquisitions. This was partially offset by strategic investments and unfavorable business mix.', 'Let me now turn to our updated 2022 guidance. And as Marc outlined, we’re raising our full year revenue guidance by $700 million to $43.15 billion.', 'We’re also raising our core organic revenue growth outlook from 9% to 11%. And on the bottom line, we’re raising our adjusted EPS guidance for 2022 by $0.28 to $22.93. The increase in revenue guidance is driven by three elements: a $750 million increase in the outlook for the core business; $500 million higher assumed COVID-19 testing revenue; and a $550 million decrease to reflect the recent changes in FX rates.', 'Let me provide you some color on each of these elements.', 'So starting with the $750 million increase in the outlook for the core business, this reflects a strong performance in Q2 and a $100 million increase in the core organic outlook for the second half of the year, and that second half raise reflects higher price we put in place to offset higher inflation versus the previous guidance.', 'As I mentioned previously, the increase in core revenue guidance raised the full year outlook for core organic revenue growth from 9% to 11%. This very strong growth performance reflecting excellent commercial execution and strong share gains.', 'In terms of our COVID-19 testing revenue assumptions, the $500 million increase for the year includes $400 million beat in Q2 and a $100 million increase in the assumption for Q3. This reflects an assumed glide path from Q2 to an endemic run rate level in Q4. There continue to be scenarios where testing demand could be higher than this level. And should that be the case, we’re well positioned to support customer needs. And as we did in the first half of the year, will flow the benefits of that through our P&L. But for now, we thought it was prudent to continue to take a de-risked approach to the outlook.', 'In terms of FX, we’ve incorporated current rates into guidance, and we now expect FX to be a year-over-year headwind on of $1.25 billion on revenue, up 3.2%. The FX headwind on adjusted EPS in 2022 has increased by $0.31 to $0.84 for the full year or 3.3%. The $0.31 change includes a 34% headwind in the second half of the year versus that previous guidance.', 'In terms of profitability, we expect to deliver $110 million more adjusted operating income, up the $700 million raise in revenue guidance. This reflects strong pull-through in the higher core and testing volume, additional price offsetting inflation and the impact of the headwind from FX. We now expect full year 2022 adjusted operating margin to be 25.2%.', 'In terms of adjusted EPS, our stronger outlook is enabling us to raise the 2022 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.28 from $22.65 to $22.93, further building on an already very strong outlook for the year.', 'So to recap on the guidance change, we continue to execute really well and are able to more than offset the significant FX headwinds, effectively manage inflation and still raise our full year outlook. This demonstrates the power of our proven strategy and our PPI business system execution.', 'Let me now provide you with a couple of other details on the 2022 guidance. PPD, our clinical research business is now expected to deliver $6.8 billion of revenue in 2022, which represents 12% core organic revenue growth on a full year basis for this business, up 1% from our previous guidance. We now expect the business to contribute just over $2 to adjusted EPS in the year, up $0.03 from our prior guidance.', 'Our guidance now assumes net interest expense of approximately $460 million for the year.', 'We’re assuming an adjusted income tax rate of 13.2% in 2022, slightly higher than the prior guidance.', 'We continue to assume net capital expenditures of approximately $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion and free cash flow of approximately $7 billion.', 'Our guidance still assumes $2.5 billion of capital deployment, which is a $2 billion of share buybacks to be completed in January and $475 million of capital returned to shareholders through dividends. And we continue to assume the full year average diluted share count will be between 394 million and 395 million shares. And finally, I wanted to touch on spacing of the P&L to help you with your modeling. When I think about the revenue dollars in Q3 and Q4, we expect Q4 to contribute just under 52% of the second half total. And looking at adjusted EPS on that same basis, we expect the second half total to be weighted a couple of percentage points more to Q4 than the revenue. To conclude, we delivered another excellent quarter and in a great position to achieve our 2022 goals. With that, I’ll turn the call back over to Raf.', 'So Patrick, in terms of the setup on pricing, then back to kind of a normal year for us, about 0.5% to 1 percentage point of net price across the whole business. And for the first half of the year, we’ve been running kind of slightly north of double the high end of that range. And the additional pricing we put in place is really to offset higher inflation that we’re seeing largely energy costs in Europe as we think about the change in guidance. And that change in guidance is really slightly higher revenue and no impact on adjusted operating income or adjusted EPS, but a little pressure on margin, which is the reason why the overall margin came down in the guidance from the last guidance. But that’s kind of active management of the pricing to offset the additional inflation.', 'I think looking at FX rates, if they stayed the same as they are now, that will be kind of an additional year-over-year headwind next year, about $600 million, about $0.40 of adjusted EPS. And I think about the mix of currencies and where currencies have changed. Obviously, that could change as we go through the year, but something to watch out for in corporate.', 'Yes, Dan, thanks for the question.', 'So, we have been very active on pricing from midway through last year.', 'So, it’s not just a this year thing. And we are being appropriately adjusting as we have seeing the impacts of inflation change. And as Marc mentioned before, it’s kind of how do you bring our customers with us at the same time.', 'So, we are pricing appropriately, given the economic challenges that are around and I think appropriately navigating.', 'So, I think about that, we are going to be dynamic as we go forward.', 'So, we will figure out what the markets look like, what the inflation looks like and adjust appropriately as we think about the second half of this year and then going into 2023.', 'So, it’s kind of a constant work in process is the way I view it. The teams have actually done a very good job so far, and we will continue to navigate that way.', 'So, on the gross margin, the gross margin came in exactly where I thought it would, so kind of in line with our expectations.', 'I think that on a year-over-year basis, I think a lot of people are missing the impact of PPD. It’s just under a 400 basis point impact on margin profile. And the rest really since the change both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year related to the mix in business in terms of testing versus other core and an element of pricing to offset inflation that also puts a little bit of pressure on margins so the other piece to it.', \"Welcome everyone to Cisco's third quarter fiscal 2022 quarterly earnings conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO; and Scott Herren, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release.

It looks like we have time for one more question.', \"Thank you, Amit. Chuck, I'm going to turn it over to you for some closing remarks.\", \"Thanks, Chuck. And I'll just wrap it up by saying Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call, which will reflect our fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal 2022 results will be on Wednesday, August 17, 2022, at 1:30 PM Pacific Time, 4:30 PM Eastern Time.\", \"So this concludes today's call. But if you have any further questions, feel free to reach out to the Investor Relations team. We thank you very much for joining us today.\", 'Thanks, Marilyn, and good afternoon, everyone. When we spoke with you back in February, we entered Q3 in the second half of our fiscal year with optimism despite the supply and component challenges and other headwinds impacting us and many of our peers. Many of those factors that fueled that optimism remain unchanged today.', 'We continue to see strong demand resulting in record backlog, our business transformation is progressing well and our differentiated innovation across our portfolio is helping our customers embrace and adopt the multiple technology transitions happening.', 'However, there were two unanticipated events since our last earnings call, which impacted our Q3 revenue performance.', 'The first is the war in Ukraine. This resulted in us ceasing operations in Russia and Belarus and had a corresponding revenue impact, which Scott will discuss.', 'The second relates to COVID related lockdowns in China, which began in late March. These lockdowns resulted in an even more severe shortage of certain critical components. This in turn prevented us from shipping products to customers at the levels we originally anticipated heading into Q3.', 'Our Q4 guidance incorporates a wider than usual range, taking into account the revenue impact of the war in Ukraine and the continuing uncertainty related to the China COVID lockdowns.', \"Given this uncertainty, we're being practical about the current environment and erring on the side of caution in terms of our outlook, taking it one quarter at a time. We believe that our revenue performance in the upcoming quarters is less dependent on demand and more dependent on the supply availability in this increasingly complex environment.\", \"While certain aspects of the current situation are largely out of our control, our teams have been working on several mitigation actions to help alleviate many of the component issues that we've been facing. We believe that we will begin to see the benefits of these actions in the first half of next fiscal year.\", 'Now let me talk more specifically about our third quarter performance.', \"As I just mentioned, many of the positives we've discussed over the past few quarters remain, resulting in continued solid demand for our solutions. Total product orders grew 8% year-over-year leading to yet another record backlog of well over $15 billion, up 10% sequentially and up 130% year-over-year. This momentum reaffirms the critical role we play in our customers' futures.\", 'Our business transformation also progressed nicely. In Q3, we saw ARR growth of 11%, ending the quarter at over $22 billion, and product ARR growth of 18%.', 'We also exited the quarter with over $30 billion in remaining performance obligations or RPO.', 'We also delivered non-GAAP EPS at the high end of our guidance range. This was driven by effective pricing actions and spending discipline, all of which allowed us to offset lower volumes and deliver both gross and operating margins above the high end of our guidance range and deliver on our bottom-line profitability target for the quarter. I want to reiterate what I said earlier. The fundamental drivers across our business are strong.', \"While we are facing some short-term challenges, it does not change our long-term outlook, our alignment to our customers' most critical challenges or our belief in the tremendous opportunities in front of us. Last week, we hosted our Global Customer Advisory Board meeting where we met with close to 100 customers. And they consistently shared that technology is at the heart of their strategy and has become even more important to everything they do. This driving not just their strategies, but also their overall business transformation. The technology they're adopting from Cisco is driving their business agility, allowing them to move with greater speed and empowering them to deliver differentiated experiences for their customers.\", \"Now I'd like to touch on some highlights from the quarter.\", 'We continue to see strong demand in several areas of our business.', \"Our web-scale business remains strong as we continue to help these customers build their capabilities to connect and serve their customers and end users at scale from the data center to the edge. This is leading to continued strength in orders, which grew over 50% and on a trailing four-quarter basis, we had over 100% growth. This marks our ninth consecutive quarter of solid demand as we are winning new franchises, expanding our design wins and taking share in web scale. I remain incredibly proud of the progress we've made in the momentum we have in this space.\", \"We are also extremely pleased with the traction of our 400 gig solutions, including the Cisco 8,000, which is the fastest growing SP routing platform in Cisco's history.\", 'In addition, our Silicon One portfolio, ZR and ZR plus optics and our Acacia portfolio of optical networking products also continue to perform well. From a product revenue perspective, our performance was led by solid demand across a majority of our portfolio, including switching, SP routing, wireless, security and SD WAN.', 'Our performance in these areas reflecting ongoing investments that our customers are making to rapidly digitize their organizations to deliver differentiated experiences.', \"Looking forward, the shift to hybrid cloud, 5G, 400 gig, IoT, hybrid work and the explosion of applications are driving the increased need for next generation networking, connectivity, security, and observability solutions. Cisco is well positioned to deliver for our customers with our end-to-end platforms and solutions. I'm also very proud of our pace of innovation.\", 'During the quarter, Cisco announced new innovations across our networking and cloud portfolios along with technologies to enhance experiences and hybrid work environments.', 'We also introduced our new predictive networks to help organizations learn, predict and avoid network disruptions.', \"We have even more innovation, which we'll announce at RSA and our own Cisco Live event in June.\", 'In addition to our deep passion for innovation, all of us at Cisco believe we have a unique opportunity to help make the world a better place through both the technology we build and the purpose we rally around to power an inclusive future for all. I believe this intersection of technology and purpose is why we were named the number one Best Company to Work For in the U.S. by Fortune and Great Place to Work for the second year in a row. In summary, while the quarter clearly did not play out as expected, demand remains solid and the fundamentals of our business are strong. We remain focused on executing against the strategy we laid out at our Investor Day.', \"We will also continue to be resolute in our focus to transform our business for more predictability and agility while bringing to market a robust pipeline of innovation. We remain confident in our long-term growth and the opportunities that we have in front of us. I want to thank our teams around the world for all that they do, executing with dedication, focus and excellence in an incredibly dynamic environment. They continue to focus on our customers with unparalleled innovation, resiliency and determination. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Scott.\", 'Yes, Meta. Thank you.', \"So on the demand issue, I'd point out a few things. Number one, without a 2-percentage point of orders that we de-booked relative to Russia and Belarus, we grew 10% against a year ago growth of 10%.\", 'So we feel good about that.', \"Our customers are not signaling any real shift at this point. We're not hearing that from them. Again, we had our global customer advisory board just a couple of weeks ago where we had 100 of our biggest customers and they were all talking about projects in the strategic nature of everything they're trying to accomplish. The last thing I would point out is on the enterprise side, last quarter we grew 37%.\", 'Just to keep in mind the way we define enterprise is a finite list of named customers.', 'So it tends to be more lumpy. If I look at how the industry defines enterprise, that would reflect a combination of our enterprise and our commercial business.', \"So for comparisons to what we're hearing in the marketplace, I thought we would give you that combined number.\", 'If you combine enterprise and commercial together, we grew 9%, but without the Russia impact, we actually grew 12% and on a trailing 12 months basis it grew 28%.', \"So we are still comfortable with the demand signals that we're seeing and our customers aren't telling us anything differently right now.\", \"Great, thanks. I'll pass it on.\", \"Yes. Samik, it's a great question.\", 'So let me start with just the basic answer is there is no reflection of demand issue in our Q4 guide, that has nothing to do with the Q4 guide.', 'Let me try to describe how we got to that.', \"I think it's important for everybody to understand. When we look at our Q3 results, we had -- from a revenue perspective, we had $200 million impact from us ceasing operations in Russia and corresponding revenue write-downs that occurred. Those were one-time. We then had, if you recall, our quarter ends at the end of April. Most of what you've heard from others, they are quarters into the end of March.\", \"So we experienced an entire quarter of the China lockdowns. In Shanghai, it was from March 27 until today. Shenzhen shut down, but again it opened up a week later, so we're talking really about the Shanghai situation.\", \"So we had $200 million from Russia and then we had $300 million that was completely attributed to our inability to get power supplies out of China. That's the simplicity of what caused the problem.\", \"As an example, we had 11,000 PCB assemblies built, we couldn't get power supplies for because of the lockdown. That's a simple fact of what happened in Q3. When we look at Q4 and you think about the Shanghai lockdown and what we've heard because in Shanghai, there are lots of components that go into our power supplies.\", \"So we're not able to get those components. Shanghai now is saying they're going to open up June 1. We don't know exactly what that means and what that means to win that implies that we would start getting any supply out. And correspondingly we believe when they open up and when they do allow transportation logistics to start up, we believe there is going to be a high degree of congestion. We believe that there is going to be lots of competition for ports capacity, airport capacity. And we just believe that that combined with the inbound efforts, trying to get raw materials back into the country, et cetera, we just believe that it's going to be impossible for us to catch up on this issue in Q4, which is what led to the guidance in Q4.\", \"So even though these top line numbers don't look good, it's very simple explanation as to what occurred.\", 'So then the follow-on part of your question is, when do we think this gets better. Well, if we make the assumption that China does begin to open up and we do begin to get more natural flow of the power supplies.', 'We also have had our teams over the last six to nine months have been working on a lot of mitigating actions, redesigning 100 products, over 100 products to give us component diversity, we believe that a combination of those starting in our Q1 and in the first half of our year will start to see the benefit of that.', \"So, that's when we expect to see it improve to some extent. We need to get through the next 90 days, but I'm just being as transparent as I can about what we see and when we think some of that improvement will occur.\", 'Yes, Ittai, thank you. Both good questions.', \"I think on the first one, I think that the biggest differentiation was April. I have spoken to peers who are feeling the same thing we are that we are reporting the full month of impact and it wasn't April issue for us.\", 'So now on a normalized basis for that question across the portfolio, all of us design products with different components in.', \"So there is opportunity for us to have a unique issue with one component that we may have designed into a product or we may have an unique advantage because we designed a certain component into a product. And those are the areas where I talked about we're redesigning where we have unique problems or just problems in general, though others may have the same problems.\", \"So we think that the exposure in general was because of the month of April. Also we do massive volumes. And in general, you would think that's a huge advantage, but just to put it in perspective, we shipped more revenue in the last week of our quarter than many of our competitors that you're referencing shipped in their entire quarter.\", \"So it's just an issue that it shows up in a bigger number for us than it would. If they have the same problem, it might be a $20 million impact for us, it might be a $200 million -- $400 million impact.\", \"So that's the first one.\", 'The second one what I would say is that we are constantly evaluating our global supply chain.', \"And so it's not about one country, it's about resilience. And the way we've designed supply chains over the last 15-20 years as an industry, I think we all realize we're evolving that now at the same time that we're triaging all of the current issues that we have.\", 'So our teams have a dual challenge. But we are constantly driving geographic resilience. The example I would give is that we -- before COVID we had regional redundancy built in, we did not have a plan for a country to shut down.', 'And so it takes time to go out and create that geographic resilience, but our teams are working on all of those kinds of things right now, so they will continue to do that any time.', 'Yes. It absolutely does, Simon.', \"Let me start and then I'll kick it to Scott to talk a little bit about it.\", 'So, first and foremost, we are incredibly active purchasers in the broker market. And you can imagine, with our buying power, they call us first.', 'And so -- no, that has nothing to do with it.', \"In fact, we've spent a lot of time with our supply chain team who had given us examples of where they've bought product in the broker market recently.\", \"So I don't think that's it. But Scott can explain what did happen there.\", \"First, I'll let Scott add on the price increase in a moment, but first of all, the price increase really did not have significant impact on our growth. We only passthrough pricing at the time that was offsetting our incremental cost. And to be honest, we've incurred more cost since then.\", \"So we were at a place right now where we have not even passed through all the costs that we have incurred. We're getting price increases all the time now.\", \"So that's the first answer.\", 'On the second one, the easiest thing for me to tell you is what I said earlier that the way our peers view and report and the industry views and reports enterprise would be the combination of our enterprise and commercial business which last quarter would have grown 9% and would have grown 12% without -- or it grew 9%, but would have been 12% without Russia.', \"So if you think about the size of that those two businesses combined growing 9%, I'm pretty comfortable that the demand is still there. And if you look at our commercial business, which usually is the leading indicator of a shift of demand momentum, they grew 19% in the quarter.\", \"So I'm not concerned.\", \"I got you Rod and you're actually thinking about the right way.\", \"You think about exactly the way I'm thinking about it.\", \"So first thing I'll say is that I think any seasonality right now is out the window with the current situation and with what we've seen with the order demand. We were doing 18-month planning with certain customers. And if they placed 18 months' worth of orders last quarter and now they're going to pause and we may be doing it with three fewer customers this quarter.\", \"So I mean it's just -- it's a very difficult thing to get your head around.\", \"So there's two things that I look at. Number one, what is our quarterly growth rate vis-a-vis a year ago to see because I think about momentum of demand from one quarter to the next sort of -- you have to look at that delta, right. Because if you grow 30% on 1% and then you grew 30% on 15%, then that would be declining demand momentum. That's the way I think about the math, right.\", \"So that's one thing we watch for. But the second thing is I think to your point I've been talking to the team about it, when we start comparing against these 30% quarters, I think we have to go back two years and get a real assessment because those numbers we know had pull ahead in. We don't know how much as we've talked about, but I think you're right.\", \"We have to sort of doing analysis from two years back to really feel like what do we really seeing right now and that's -- it's going to be a difficult thing for us to navigate because the historical way we've looked at these metrics just won't apply right now. And I think once we cycle through a year, another four quarters of the stuff, maybe we get to normalized -- a normalized view.\", \"As I've said, we're going to go through a phase where our order demand growth will be lagging our revenue growth and then hopefully we'll get to a point where those two will get back into more of a predictive model and we just got to get there.\", 'I think COVID changed everything about how our customers think about technology.', \"I think that pre-COVID a lot of customers when they went to slow spending, they would stop spending on technology. And I think COVID had them feel the impact of those decisions. And they're not -- they're going to be very prudent about stopping key projects that are giving them customer differentiation capabilities or modernization of their infrastructure or supporting hybrid work or making sure they're not falling behind their competitors. I mean, it's just a different day to day relative to what CEOs, the public sector leaders, how they think about technology and the importance of it. Even though they thought it, it was really important three years ago, their understanding of today is much different.\", \"And so I'm not saying they won't make those decisions. I just think there is a higher bar for them to make those decisions.\", 'You want to take it, Scott?', \"Hi, Paul. Thanks. Yes, we had -- in Q3, it was very simple for us to articulate it because we know exactly what we were expecting and everything else. We don't have the ability in Q4 to understand when they're really going to open up and how much we're going to get, et cetera, which caused us to create the range we did. And just -- we're just being realistic about what we believe we'll be able to get out the door, but to actually peg it to power supplies, in particular, is pretty difficult. But I mean most of the issues that we see right now, the concerning area right now is really getting that open -- getting China opened up again, getting the stuff shipping and we need to see that.\", 'So Scott, you want to add something?', \"Q3 was right in line with normal pattern. And I think Paul, the thing to remember is, yes, we're a little skewed because we had three quarters of 30%. If we went back a year and a half and I said we're going to grow 10% product orders on top of a 10% quarter from a year ago, we would have been quite happy with it. We're just worried about it because it's fallen 330s when there was a lot of planned purchase built into.\", \"So we will tell you. Obviously next quarter we'll have an update, but right now, it doesn't feel like there's any significant shift.\", \"Paul, that's fine. But we never have any commentary about future bookings expectations.\", 'On the RPO that we talked about, you got the number right, $16.2 billion of short-term RPO, which is up 9%.', \"And so short term by definition means that accretes into the revenue stream in the next 12 months. That growing by 9% is a pretty good leading indicator of at least what that piece of -- how that piece of our business looks as we go into Q4 and then we'll give you an update on how short-term RPO growth looks at the end of Q4 and you can get a sense of it in the end of fiscal '23.\", 'You want to take it, Scott?', 'Yes, I mean with the backlog.', 'So a couple of things.', \"I think what you may be trying to get out on the backlog question is the durability of that backlog. And there is -- this is something that obviously we've been tracking very closely. What I'd say on order cancellations is they continue to run at a rate that is actually below where it was pre-pandemic.\", \"So we're not seeing any cancellations there.\", 'We continue to see very strong pipeline and pipeline build, which is something else that I think you would expect to see weaken if there was softening demand.', \"As we look at kind of further out with what's sitting in the backlog, we've also put in place a policy change that says those orders are non-cancelable with all orders are non-cancelable within 45 days of the committed ship date. That just went into place in the beginning of February.\", \"So orders that we've received since then within 45 days of shipment are non-cancelable. And for our biggest customers, we've been working with them on a bespoke basis to put in place agreements where we will guarantee supply, but they guarantee that those orders will not be rescheduled or canceled.\", \"So feel good about the durability of the backlog we've got.\", 'So, Tim, on the first one -- thanks for the questions, by the way.', \"On the first one, I think that as we see if we see reductions in our input costs over time, then we will take into consideration whether we pass those through to the customers. The reality is as we've taken on so many input costs increases that we haven't passed onto customers that will look at it holistically at the time where that stuff begins to occur is what I would tell you. I'm glad you asked on the software growth because I think it's something that we want to explain.\", \"So it's a little difficult to understand completely and we have a really interesting quarter because the extra week a year ago in the Russia situation and the supply chain situation.\", \"So let me try to take you through what's going on in software.\", 'If you start with the fact that we have well over $2 billion of software in backlog that is connected to a piece of hardware that we will not begin recognizing the revenue until the hardware ships.', \"So -- and that's up $1 billion year-over-year.\", \"So there is a large component of software that we're not recognizing right now that we would in normal times.\", \"So it's the first piece. And then if you take into consideration the extra week from a year ago where we do ratable recognition of revenue on a daily basis, we had an extra week. And then you take the software that we wrote down -- software revenue that we wrote down as a result of ceasing operations in Russia.\", \"So those three -- the first one is hard to put a number on, but assume it's reasonable. The Russia and the extra quarter was a 5-point headwind to our software growth.\", \"So I know it's a little complicated, but I wanted to make sure you understood that.\", \"So I would expect this stuff to normalize back particularly without the Russia and the extra week impact. And then when supply chain starts to clear, then we'll start to see those normalized growth rates that we would expect, so hopefully that wasn't too complicated.\", \"Yes. The renewal stuff in '23, it could be helpful.\", \"We are continuing to make progress on that across the portfolio. I mean, we've got subscriptions running on switching on routing, enterprise routing, on enterprise wireless. We've even built some subscriptions into our mass scale infrastructure group. We've got subscriptions now in our data center networking group.\", \"So they'll sort layering in over the next few years.\", 'So first of all I think market share is incredibly difficult thing to assess right now because of the backlog situation, supply chain situations and we have a complex portfolio.', \"So are we losing share in somewhere? I suspect there is somewhere that we are losing share. But in our core markets, I actually feel really good about how we're performing and the demand that we've seen in whether it's WiFi or switching or particularly in SP routing and in the web scale space and other areas.\", \"So I don't think there is a widespread problem of share, but I'm sure there are pockets that we -- our teams are working on improving.\", \"So that's the first piece. Amit, on the China thing, let me -- what we've built into the guide is just a whole lot of uncertainty right now. Because we recognize that when they do open up, first of all, we don't know what that means. We don't know what open up means. Does it mean that they're going to slowly open grocery stores and salons and things of that nature and that the logistics side of it or do they open up the logistics all day one? What does it mean about the capacity of resources they have for the logistics side? But our concern is that every company there is going to be trying to ship out? In some cases, many of the factories have been approved to keep working and their workers have been working in dormitories.\", \"So they have components or ready to ship product that is sitting on the floor and it's all going to raise for the ports. It's all going to compete for the airports. And we know there's lower air traffic capacity right now for us to leverage.\", \"So we're concerned about how long it takes to clear that up, which is reflected in the guide.\", 'We also think that once it gets into their ports and it starts coming in the U.S., we have the risk of seeing what we saw in LA several months ago.', \"So those are all just the unknowns about what does opening up look like and what's the timeframe for recovery that led us to the cautious guide that we put out there. And I would just remind you that it's not just Shanghai.\", 'I think as of the last article I read, there were like 45 cities that were in lockdown and it was over a quarter of the population of China.', \"So it's broader. But that's how we're thinking about it and we just have to wait and see how it unwinds.\", \"So first of all, I want to thank everybody for spending time with us and diving into this the complex situation that we face. It's clearly a dynamic and challenging environment. We clearly faced unanticipated events during Q3 with the COVID lockdowns and the war in Ukraine. We think the short-term challenges that we will manage through, our teams have been working really hard on these mitigation actions that we believe will begin to benefit us in the first half of our next fiscal year, which is good. We're successfully realizing price increases, which is good. And also in Q3, even though we had a miss on the top line, I just want to point out that it was a record EPS quarter for us as a company. And at the low point of our guidance for Q4, we will deliver record EPS for the full year.\", \"So while the topline is disappointing, we have navigated this complex year and actually will deliver solid EPS when we're done. The fundamentals are strong a lot, still in our favor. Demand, business transformation is working, the technology transitions and the number that we're participating in.\", 'We have great teams around the world and that leads me to have a high degree of confidence despite the short-term challenges that we face.', 'So thank you all for spending time with us and we look forward to connecting with you next quarter.', 'Thanks, Chuck. We saw solid growth in product orders, net income and earnings per share despite the challenges Chuck just outlined. Product order growth was driven by strength across most of our portfolio while disciplined spend and supply chain management drove our profitability. Total revenue was $12.8 billion, flat year-over-year.', \"Our non-GAAP operating margin was 34.7%, up 110 basis points coming in above the high end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP net income was $3.6 billion, up 3% and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.87, up 5%, coming in at the high end of our guidance range. In March, we stopped business operations in both Russia and Belarus, which had a negative impact to revenue of approximately $200 million or two percentage points of growth. Historically, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine collectively have represented approximately 1% of our total revenue. The impact this quarter was a bit higher than our historical run rate due to additional charges to revenue we recorded for uncollectible receivables and other items. And as a reminder, Q3 of last year included an extra week, which was a benefit of total revenue in Q3 of '21 of approximately three, four percentage points of growth. On a combined basis, the impact of the year-over-year total revenue growth rate for the extra week and the war in Ukraine was approximately five percentage points.\", 'Looking at our Q3 revenue in more detail, total product revenue was $9.4 billion, up 3%. Service revenue was $3.4 billion, down 8%, driven by the extra week in the prior year and the war in Ukraine, which combined, impacted our growth by approximately 8 percentage points. Within product revenue, Secure, Agile Networks was solid with revenues up 4%, switching grew driven by strength in data center switching with our Nexus 9000 products, campus switching growth was led by our Catalyst 9000 and Meraki switching offerings. Wireless had a double-digit increase driven by broad-based strength across our portfolio, including our WiFi-6 products and Meraki wireless offerings.', 'We also had solid growth in Servers. Enterprise routing declined primarily driven by Edge and Access was slightly offset by strength in SD-WAN. Internet for the Future was up 6%, driven by strength in Acacia, optical, optics and core networking products including double-digit growth in the Cisco 8000. Collaboration was down 7%, driven by declines in our meetings, calling and contact center offerings, partially offset by the continued ramp of our communication platform-as-a-service. End-to-End Security grew 7% with broad strength across most of the portfolio.', 'Our Zero Trust portfolio performed well with double-digit growth driven by strong performance in our Duo offering. Optimized Application Experiences was up 8%, driven by double-digit growth in both of our SaaS based offerings ThousandEyes and Intersight.', \"We continue to make progress on our transformation metrics as we shift our business to more subscriptions and software. Total software revenue was $3.7 billion, a decrease of 3% with the product portion down 1%. Total software revenue growth would have been 5 points higher excluding the combined negative impact of the extra week in the prior year and the war in Ukraine. 83% of software revenue was subscription-based, which is up one percentage point year-on-year. Total subscription revenue was $5.5 billion, a decrease of 4%. Total subscription revenue would have been 7 points higher, excluding the combined negative impact of the extra week in the prior year and the war in Ukraine. Total subscription revenue represented 43% of Cisco's total revenue. Annualized recurring revenue or ARR was $22.4 billion, an increase of 11% with strong product ARR growth of 18%. And remaining performance obligations or RPO was $30.2 billion, up 7%. Product RPO increased 13%, service RPO increased 3%, and the total short term RPO grew 9% to $16.2 billion. We had solid product order growth in Q3 of 8% with strength across most of the business.\", 'Looking at our geographic segments, the Americas was up 9%, EMEA up 4%, and APJC up 11%. In our customer markets, commercial was up 19%, service provider was up 8%, public sector was up 4%, and enterprise was flat. From a non-GAAP perspective, total gross margin came in above the high end of our guidance range at 65.3%, down 70 basis points year-over-year. Product gross margin was 64.1%, down 80 basis points and service gross margin was 68.9%, up 20 basis points. The decrease in product gross margin was primarily driven by ongoing higher component costs related to supply constraints as well as higher freight and logistics costs, partially offset by strong positive pricing impact.', 'We continue to manage through the supply constraints seen industrywide by us and our peers. To give a sense of scale of the shortages, we currently see constraints in Q4 on roughly 350 critical components, out of a total of 41,000 unique component part numbers.', 'Our supply chain team is aggressively pursuing multiple options to close those shortages.', 'Given our solid product orders, we once again saw a significant increase in our backlog levels for both hardware and software well beyond our normal historical levels.', 'As Chuck said, our ending product backlog grew to well over $15 billion and software backlog grew to more than $2 billion, both up 10% sequentially. And just a reminder, backlog is not included as part of our $30.2 billion and remaining performance obligations. We ended Q3 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $20.1 billion. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $3.7 billion, down 6% year-over-year, primarily driven by advanced payments to secure future supply. These advanced payments had a negative 9 percentage point year-on-year impact on Q3 operating cash flow.', \"In terms of capital allocation, we returned $1.8 billion to shareholders during the quarter, that was comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and approximately $250 million of share repurchases. Year-to-date, we have returned a total of approximately $10 billion in value to our shareholders via cash dividends and stock repurchases and more than $17 billion available under our Board stock repurchase authorization. To summarize, we're navigating the highly complex environment while continuing to make progress on our business model shift and making strategic investments in innovation to capitalize on our significant growth opportunities and expanding addressable markets.\", 'Now let me provide our financial guidance for Q4.', 'In terms of supply, we expect the challenges we experienced in Q3 to continue into Q4.', 'For next quarter, we expect revenue growth to be in the range of minus 1% to minus 5.5%. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 64% to 65%.', 'Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 31.5% to 33.5% and non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.76 to $0.84.', \"For the full year fiscal '22, guidance is as follows.\", \"We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 2% to 3% year-on-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is expected to range from $3.29 to $3.37, up 2% to 5% year-on-year. In both our Q4 and full year guidance, we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A.\", \"Yes, it's a great question, Simon. What I'd add is, if you recall, we did two price increases this year.\", \"The first one enrolled in right about the end of the calendar year and the second one at the beginning of our second quarter. And we said at the time that we thought -- you continue to ask like what are those price increases, when they are going to show up in the top line? And we said we thought we would begin to see the benefit of those toward the end of the third quarter, which is the quarter we just closed and that's exactly what happened.\", \"So while the unit shipments in the quarter were off because of the issues that we've talked about with the supply chain with the component supply, the -- we were able to offset that with pretty strong pricing.\", \"In fact, the list -- we published this in our Q, so you'll see it there, but our pricing was up about 160 basis points in Q3.\", \"So while we do have a unit impact from the component supply, it was offset by some of the things that we're doing in the -- we are beginning to realize on the price front.\", \"We are actively pursuing every avenue. It's got to be a qualified vendor and so we're working to qualify different sources at the same time.\", \"We are actively pursuing that whether it's through a broker, obviously directly from the vendor, but through a broker, distributor, we're pursuing all those channels and that is creating a bit of a headwind to us.\", 'Yes. And Sami to the first part of your question, the 160 basis point impact that we saw in Q3 from pricing is a revenue statement. Obviously to go from bookings to revenue, it first has to flow through the backlog and then get realized.', \"So the impact on bookings while we haven't quantified, it would be a little bit higher than that 160 basis points.\", \"Yes, Tal, I think the way to think about it is back to one of the statistics that we gave you first time last quarter and then again this quarter. We've got backlog now greater than $15 billion in product. And within that, more than $2 billion of software sitting in backlog.\", \"You add that to the $30 billion plus of RPO we've got and we're sitting on about $45 billion of sales we've transacted that have not yet accreted to the revenue line.\", \"So I think it for as you think about the way you want to model out next year, you need to think about the rate and pace of revenue growth being dependent on supply versus being dependent on in quarter bookings growth. And that's certainly the way I think about it.\", \"Yes, I think some of that is available in the slides that we'll put up online. It may also be in the press release. We talked about enterprise. Enterprise orders were flat for the quarter, but then you have to normalize in the impact of the Russia and Belarus, the decision to stop operations in Russia and Belarus, that would take it up to 3% growth in orders. That's following a quarter where enterprise grew 37% and the quarter before that it grew 30%.\", \"So with these -- the way we define enterprise, as Chuck talked about, it's our biggest customers. And that business by definition is going to be a bit lumpy. But on a trailing 12 months, it's actually quite strong.\", \"We continue to see nice growth in SP, particularly in web scale. We gave you some of those stats during the call as well. Those are doing well. Public sector continues to hold up. Public sector demand has continued to be fine for us. And commercial, you remember we talked about this when we first went into the pandemic that we saw commercial tip down before the rest of the sales tip down. And then as things begin to recover in late fiscal '20, we saw commercial tip up. It tends to be a leading indicator for us. And commercial growth product, order growth was up 19% last quarter.\", \"So we're not seeing -- if that's the leading indicator and it certainly has been for us, we're not seeing any weakness in demand at this point.\", \"Yes, what I'd add to that is we give the example of power supplies because that was a constraint in Q3 and part of the issue that we had in Q3 is that constraint came up very late in the quarter, right. When Shanghai went into lockdown, we didn't immediately see that hit. It hit more towards the second half of April which, of course, was within our quarter. It wasn't within the quarter of many of our peers. And there was just no time to recover from that, but I don't want you to oversimplify and I hope I'm not leading into that. It's not just power supplies. We've got issues in a number of different areas. I tried to give you a sense of scale because I know it's 41,000 unique components what we said is about 350 have potential supply concerns right now. We're working those every day and every day some of them get resolved and then every day a couple more will come on to that list.\", \"So it's not -- unfortunately, it would be convenient if it was just one or two things and we could say here's exactly what those are. It is a very dynamic situation. And what we're trying to do if you zoom up a level and say, we're not assuming it gets better or worse as we scroll through Q4 and that's what's built into the guide.\", 'Zero. There is no demand impact our Q4 guide.', 'It was normal, very normal.', \"Yes, there is kind of two angles to that David that I'll try to touch on. One is the, when does the backlog itself peak and while we don't forecast that, it would not surprise me to see it grow again in Q4.\", \"On the second piece in terms of purchase commitments you saw they were up pretty substantially again in Q3, I guess, back to the earlier question of as our supply chain team not being aggressive enough in pursuing parts, purchase commitments now set at a pretty high level and inventory sits at a pretty high level. And that's so that as we clear the supply constraints on a few critical components, we can actually quickly convert that into finished goods product and get it in the hands of our customers who want those products.\", \"So is the peak now, is the peak in Q4, Q1, really a lot depends on the fluidity of availability of these critical components that we're chasing down?\", \"I hope that makes sense to you. We were sitting on both a record backlog and record inventory, which seems like it's in contrast with one another. But it's not, right. We're holding onto the parts that we've got and we just have to get the remainder to square the sets and get those built out the door.\", \"Yes. Ben on the first part of your question, I didn't exactly follow your math, but relative to expectations we talked about, yes, in the month of April, we talked about the -- obviously the decision we made to stop operations in Russia, Belarus, had a $200 million impact of the quarter. Most of that was -- it was two months of revenue that we had to forego and there were some receivables we had to write off within that.\", \"On the supply chain side, we would have made up the remainder of that delta to our expectations for the quarter. I hope that answers your question. I'm not quite sure I followed what you were trying to get at with that.\", \"Yes. I don't actually think about it in those terms.\", \"But yes, again if that didn't answer your question, Ben, we can follow-up afterwards.\", 'Good morning. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, will discuss second quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded.', \"Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our second quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement, and presentation deck are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Charlie.\", \"Thanks very much, John. Good morning. I'll make some brief comments about our second quarter results, the operating environment, and update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review second quarter results in more detail before we take your questions.\", 'Let me start with some second quarter highlights. We earned $3.1 billion in the second quarter, our results included a $576 million impairment of equity securities, predominantly in our venture capital business due to market conditions. Revenue declined as growth in net interest income driven by rising interest rates and higher loan balances was more than offset by lower non-interest income as market conditions negatively impacted our venture capital, mortgage banking, investment banking, and wealth management advisory businesses.', 'We continued to execute on our efficiency initiatives and our expenses declined from a year ago even with inflationary pressures and higher operating losses. We had broad-based loan growth with both our consumer and commercial portfolios growing from the first quarter and a year ago. Credit performance remained strong, our allowance reflected an increase due to loan growth.', \"While we're monitoring risks related to continued high inflation, increasing interest rates, and the slowing economy, which will impact our customers, consumers and businesses have been resilient so far. When looking at simple averages across our entire portfolio, consumer deposit balances per account increased from first quarter and a year ago and remained above pre-pandemic levels. Overall, our consumer deposit customers' health indicators, including cash flow, payroll, and overdraft trends are not showing elevated risk concerns.\", \"However, we're closely monitoring activity by segment for signs of potential stress and for certain cohorts of customers, we have seen average balances steadily decline to pre-pandemic levels.\", 'Following the final federal stimulus payments early last year and their debit card spend has also been declining. Overall, debit card spending was up 3% compared to a year ago when consumers receive stimulus payments and then sanction appears to be impacting certain categories of spending, including a 26% increase in fuel driven by higher prices, while discretionary categories like apparel and home improvement spending were down double digits, driven by fewer transactions. Credit card spend increased 28% from a year ago. Above the industry trend driven by the new products we launched last year, with double-digit increases across all spend categories.', 'However, spending while still strong, started to slow in May and June. Consumer credit card utilization rates remain below pre-pandemic levels. Payment rates remained strong and delinquency rates remain low.', 'Our small business portfolio continues to perform well in the aggregate in both delinquencies and losses. Leading indicators such as payment rates, deposit levels, utilization and revolving debt trends do not yet indicate signs of stress. Loan demand from our commercial customers remained strong with broad-based balance and commitment growth.', \"Our commercial customers' credit performance remained strong with exceptionally low net charge-offs and non-accrual loans were at their lowest level in over 10 years.\", 'However, we are monitoring early warning indicators across portfolios including cash flow activity, credit line utilization rates and industry fundamentals for inflation impacts.', \"Now let me update you on progress we've made on our strategic priorities.\", 'Our work to build an appropriate risk and control infrastructure is ongoing and remains our top priority, but we also continue to invest in our businesses to better serve our customers and to help drive growth. This week, we launched our fourth new credit card offering in the past year, Wells Fargo Autograph.', \"Our latest card reflects our momentum in growing our consumer credit card business with new accounts up over 60% from a year ago. We're focused on delivering competitive offerings and our new reward card provides three times points across top spending categories including restaurants, travel and gas stations. This is the first of several rewards based cards we plan to introduce.\", 'We continue to improve the digital experience in the second quarter with the relaunch of Intuitive Investor, our automated digital investing platform. We simplified the account opening process and created a faster and better experience for both new and experienced investors.', 'During the second quarter, we began rolling out Wells Fargo Premier, which provides differentiated products and experiences focused on strengthening and growing our affluent client relationships.', 'We are working towards offering one set of products and services that are tailored to the needs of these customers regardless of where they sit within our individual businesses.', 'We will be rolling out more enhancements in the coming quarters to provide a more compelling offering for Premier clients. We started to roll out overdraft policy changes late in the first quarter, which included the elimination of fees for non-sufficient funds and overdraft protection transactions.', 'Additional changes will be rolled out in the second half of this year, including providing customers who overdraw their account with a 25-hour grace period to cure a negative balance before incurring an overdraft fee, giving early access to eligible direct deposits and providing a new easy short-term credit product.', 'We expect these changes will help millions of consumer customers avoid overdraft fees and meet short-term cash needs, and we continue to review other ways we can help consumers manage their finances.', \"We also continue to invest to better serve our commercial customers. And early in the second quarter, Tim O'Hara joined the Corporate Investment Bank for BlackRock as Head of Banking. Tim's expertise and insights will help us maximize our potential and achieve even greater partnership and strategic dialogue with our corporate and institutional clients, and he complements the strong leadership team in our markets and commercial real estate businesses, who have helped us navigate recent market volatility. We believe we have a significant opportunity to serve our existing commercial customers with corporate and investment banking products in a way that works within our existing risk tolerance.\", 'We also believe that for us to be successful as a company, we must consider a broad set of stakeholders in our decisions and actions. Last week, we announced that Otis Rolley will be joining Wells Fargo from the Rockefeller Foundation as the Head of Social Impact, leading community engagement and enterprise philanthropy, including the Wells Fargo Foundation.', 'We continue to move forward in the area of ESG with the announcement of our 2030 reduction targets for greenhouse gas emissions attributable to financing activities in the oil and gas and power sectors.', 'As homeownership remains out of reach for too many families, we announced an effort to support new home construction, renovation and repair of more than 450 affordable homes across the US in collaboration with Habitat for Humanity and rebuilding together.', 'We also launched our special purpose credit program to help minority homeowners refinance mortgages that Wells Fargo currently services.', 'We continue to support our small business customers through this time of uncertainty, including launching the small business resource Navigator, which connects small business owners to potential financing options and technical assistance through community development financial institutions across the country.', \"We are also helping women entrepreneurs by doubling our support for women-owned businesses through the Connector program with complementary mentorship opportunities. We published our inaugural diversity, equity and inclusion report, which highlights the meaningful positive results we've made on our DE&I initiatives.\", 'For example, in the US, our external hiring of individuals from racially or ethnically diverse populations increased by 27% in 2021 compared to 2020, and approximately one-third of all internally promoted executives last year were racially or ethnically diverse.', \"As I've said in the past, advancing DE&I at Wells Fargo is a long-term commitment, not a project and we continue to pursue many of the initiatives in the report and look for ways to deepen our impact.\", \"Let me just make some summary comments before turning it over to Mike. The Federal Reserve's commitment to an aggressive rate hike cycle as a means to tame high persistent inflation continues to fuel market volatility and is expected to slow the economy, which will impact our consumer and commercial customers. Despite the economic environment, I remain optimistic about our future. Credit quality remains strong, and we expect net interest income growth to continue given rising interest rates which should more than offset any further near-term pressure on non-interest income. We remain on target to achieve a sustainable 10% ROTCE, subject to the same assumptions we've discussed in the past, on a run rate basis in the second half of this year, and then we will discuss our path to 15%. This year's Federal Reserve stress test confirmed our strong capital position and our ability to support our customers and communities while also continuing to return excess capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases.\", \"As we previously announced, we expect to increase our third quarter common stock dividend by 20% to $0.30 per share, subject to approval by the company's Board of Directors at its regularly scheduled meeting later this month. I will now turn the call over to Mike.\", 'Hey, Ken, this is Charlie.', \"Let me take that. The way we think about it is as we sit and look towards next year, we certainly know we have some increases to contend with, such as the full year impact of inflationary pressures that we see this year. And we know we've got some increases in FDIC insurance premiums. But as we start thinking about next year, and we really just starting the budget process, our mindset going into it is that we have significant opportunities to become more efficient. We've been – and it's just more of the same in terms of what we've been talking about. And this has nothing to do with getting efficiencies out of the risk-related work it assumes that all of that investment continues. But we do go into this process with the expectation that we want to see net expense reductions.\", \"Now, just usual caveats that excludes revenue-related expenses, which could go up or some of this – the lumpiness that we've talked about, just as we think – but as we think about that core expense base, we do continue to see opportunities, and we'd like you to see it as well.\", \"Yeah. Hey, John, it's Charlie. Why don't I start and then Mike can chime in. Yeah. I mean, I think your – no question, we – clarity of SCB for us at this point does really help.\", \"As we sit here today and we look at what's happening in spreads and what's happening with the 10 year that was at 292 right now. But we do want to be all but just conservative in terms of how we think about managing the capital base.\", \"So just to be – I think to be clear, as we sit here today, we're very happy with the amount of capital that we have, including, as we think about that 10 basis points increase that will impact us. We certainly have capacity to buy shares back at this point. And as I think Mike alluded to, we just probably want to wait a little bit just to see what happens in terms of the volatility in spreads and rates before we start to do that. But we certainly at a point, we'll do it. We'll just see exactly when that is.\", 'Yes. What we said a couple of times was that we thought it was possible that it was going to increase, and it did.', 'Now you have to keep in mind, like we only have so much visibility into the underlying drivers of what causes it to go up or down in any given year.', \"Now there's a lot of stuff that's public, but there's also a lot of a lot of the modeling techniques that are quite easy to understand.\", 'And so, I would say we were pleased with the result, and we spent -- as many do probably, we spend a lot of time on trying to understand the drivers of the risk of the balance sheet and do our best to have positioned ourselves for -- toward the outcomes.', 'And so, we were pleased that’s working out.', 'Hey, John. Good morning.', \"Well, as you think about the process we go through, which I think is similar to most in a lot of ways, is you're really looking at a number of scenarios that you need to be thoughtful about and include in your modeling. And we've now, for a number of quarters in a row, have had a significant weighting on the downside scenario already.\", \"And some of those scenarios are pretty severe, right? And so you've got waitings on what some might term wild recession, more severe recessions, so you could create a lot of labels for them. But it's a number of scenarios that have different severities of downside.\", \"And so, we feel at this point that we've captured what we can look at and see or anticipate at this point based on all the factors that we need to evaluate in our current reserves. And I'll just point out also, as you look at us in the position we're in, yes, we didn't take down all of the reserves that we put up during COVID.\", \"And so as you sort of look through each of the underlying asset classes, we feel what we have today is appropriate. It's hard to see in the near term increasing them to the level that we had back in the pandemic. But I think that's a hard thing to see at this point. But I think we'll have to make sure as things evolve throughout the next couple of quarters. we'll have to incorporate that. But again, we already have a pretty significant weighting on those downside scenarios already. And it's a very -- as you would imagine, a very robust conversation that we go through each quarter to evaluate how we feel about it. And at this point, we feel it's appropriate for what we can see over the life of those loans.\", \"Yes. Yes, Erika, I think that's a really hard thing to give a pinpoint number on at this point in the cycle, to be honest with you. And if you think about -- and it's -- there's so many moving pieces right now, I think, between -- particularly as you sort of get to year-end and the pace of rates? And what exactly is the Fed going to do and when are they going to do it? And so I think there's a lot that goes into that, that trying to get a -- one number is a hard thing to say with a lot of confidence in my view.\", \"I think what we can say though is as you look at the next couple of rate rises, I think you're going to start to see more acceleration.\", \"On the retail and the consumer side, the core -- deposit core rates haven't changed much for the big banks at this point yet.\", \"So you'll start to see that happen over the next couple of rate rises, the betas will still be pretty small.\", \"However, that will start to pick up just depending on how fast the Fed goes by year-end. And then I think on the other side of the spectrum on the corporate investment bank and those deposits, whether it's in the FI space or the large corporate space, you're seeing those betas pick up a lot already.\", 'So those will continue to accelerate.', \"And so when you look at cumulative betas, you really have to look at and you start to compare different banks, you're really going to have to look at the mix of the deposits. And the CIB deposits are just a much smaller piece of the pie for us right now. And those are going to -- those will probably move faster than even we've modeled, but it's a small piece of it.\", \"So I think we'll see how it goes, and we'll give you as much insight as we can. But I think trying to predict cumulative betas by year-end is hard.\", \"No problem. I'm glad you made it rhetorical.\", \"Let me take a shot at this first. Listen, I think we have the work we're doing on all of the risk and infrastructure work, which supports the regulatory matters. It's our own headcount. It's professional. It's a bunch of technology work. It really cuts across a whole series of lines. And I just don't really think it's the right time for us to start even talking about where those saves could come from. And it's just genuinely not on a radar screen in terms of what we're thinking about where it's going to go or anything like that.\", \"So I'd rather just defer the question at this point.\", \"Sure. Yes. And that was, by the way, not meant to be a new comment. That's something that we've been doing ever since I got here, and we brought a new management, including Kristy Fercho, who runs the business. And I mean, if you just go back and look at how big we were in the mortgage business, we were a hell of a lot bigger than we are today.\", \"And so we have been all along just reassessing what makes sense for us to do, how big we want to be both in the context of what our focus should be in terms of our primary focus should be on service -- serving our own customer base -- and then to the extent that we have efficiencies, would it makes sense for us to do other business. But I guess my point was we're not interested in being extraordinarily large in the mortgage business just for the sake of being in the mortgage business. We're in the home lending business because we think home lending is an important product for us to talk to our customers about. And that will ultimately dictate the appropriate size of it.\", \"And so I would just -- when you look at how much we're originating versus the size of our servicing business. The servicing business over time will become smaller. And I think that's a smart and good thing for us for many reasons. And as I said, we're just going to -- we're going to focus on products that make sense for us in the context of where we can make money over the cycles, given all of the complexities and all the requirements that banks have that not necessarily everyone else have and make sure we're getting the right returns for it.\", \"No, yes. No, I would -- I mean, listen, we're still -- I would still assume that a substantial amount of our mortgage production would be eligible for sale. And whether it's through the agencies or through public market, that's all options that we want to continue.\", \"And so we'll still be originating mortgages across the spectrum, some of which will keep on balance sheet when it makes sense and others of which we'll sell, and we will have an MSR. Again, if you just look at how much we originated historically versus what we're originating today, it will naturally just come down over time.\", \"So Mike Weinbach, who had come in to run our home lending businesses. Put a whole series of things in place, including if you look at the leadership across all of our card business, our home lending business, our personal lending business in our auto business, all those -- that's an entirely new management team, plus new heads of -- I can go through all the other functions as well. And Mike put that in place, and we talked about it and he wanted to do something different.\", \"And so we're lucky enough to have a gentleman named Kleber Santos, who joined us 1.5 years to two years ago. Background he was a Capital One prior to that and McKinsey prior to that, and Kelber and I have worked extremely closely together and just thrilled to have him in that role.\", \"And so I think I wouldn't expect to see significant changes in the things that we've spoken about. We're focused on continuing the product build-out on the credit card side, again, focusing on customers that are broader customers in the franchise. Building our customer service around that and building out our digital capabilities and all the other parts of the business, which is work that we have underway.\", \"So I don't anticipate any material changes from where we are just with continued trends and the things that we've been talking about.\", \"Let me start, Mike. And Mike and I are both very involved in these conversations with Barry and his team I think if you look at our wealth business, it's run entirely different today than it was several years ago. We had separate platforms historically here between our brokerage business. We had two different private banks that operated under two different brands. We had our bank channel. And then completely separately, we had a digital platform, and we had a platform or advisers that wanted to go independent. The digital platforms and the platform for independent advisers had very little investment in it. And those would run -- but all of those businesses, they were run as separate businesses with separate product platforms and separate technology.\", \"And so what we've done is we now have one set of products and service capabilities that all of those product lines have access to. And we've combined the entire field under one leader. And we're investing in our digital capabilities, and we're investing in the capabilities of those that want to go independent.\", 'So if they want to do that, they can stay here as opposed to elsewhere.', \"We are building out capabilities across all the dimensions from the investment capabilities to the banking capabilities, our lending capabilities, offering trust in the other areas of distribution that didn't have access to those in the past.\", \"And so it's a huge set of changes, which also bring with it a set of changes in the back end, which we're going to move -- we're moving towards common platforms. And it's something we're really excited about, and we're just at the beginning of seeing the benefits of it. And I think it's one of the things that will make us appear to -- for our financial advisers, it’s been extremely attractive place to be, whether they want to be an employee and work for Wells Fargo or they want to be independent and access our capabilities.\", \"Yes. I would say -- yes, just not expand even further, Betsy. It's really a combination of the advisers and the products that Berry has to offer in our wealth management business. It is also leveraging the lending products that Clover is now responsible for, including credit card and including mortgage and potentially, auto and some other things there. In integrated offering with Mary's bank customers who are affluent.\", \"So it's an offering across all of our product sets directed in a much more segmented way than we've ever done in the past.\", \"And so we're extremely excited about it, and we'll be talking more about things that were capabilities that were going to be rolling out throughout the year.\", 'Yes. This is Charlie, Matt.', \"First of all, our targeted customer, those that we want to have a broader relationship with. What we have said is that as we've rolled out this new product set, when you look at the credit quality of the borrowers and the spenders that we have been giving our new cards due to the credit quality is actually stronger than it had been historically. And it still is either on target or stronger than we would have modeled for when we rolled the products out. It's just we're not competing on credit terms. We're not competing in any way, shape or form in terms of that. We just want to have a quality offering, we would expect it to be a high-quality card customer that we can do other things with across our franchise.\", 'Yes, I think you can get some of that in the Q, Matt, you got to go a little deep into the queue, but you can get some of that in the distribution table in the Q.', 'All right, everyone. Thank you very much. We appreciate everything and we look forward to talking to you all. Take care.', 'Thanks, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Net income for the quarter was $3.1 billion or $0.74 per common share, which included strong growth in net interest income as we are beginning to see the positive impact of higher interest rates.', 'Our results included a $576 million impairment of equity securities, predominantly in our venture capital business due to the market conditions, which drove a total loss from equity securities of $615 million in the second quarter. Recall that a year ago, when the markets were strong, our results included $2.7 billion of gains on equity securities.', 'While credit quality remains strong, our results included a $235 million increase in the allowance for credit losses due to loan growth, this follows six consecutive quarterly decreases in the allowance, including $1.1 billion in the first quarter and $1.6 billion a year ago. We highlight capital on Slide 3.', 'Our CET1 ratio was 10.3%, down approximately 20 basis points from the first quarter as declines in AOCI and dividend payments were largely offset by our second quarter earnings.', 'Our CET1 ratio also reflected actions we took to proactively manage our level of capital and risk-weighted assets as well as reduce our AOCI sensitivity by moving more securities the held to maturity and hedging securities in our available-for-sale portfolio.', 'Additionally, we did not buy back any shares in the second quarter. But as Charlie highlighted, the recent stress test results confirmed our capacity to return excess capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases.', 'We will continue to be prudent and consider current market conditions, including interest rate volatility, potential loan and risk-weighted asset growth as well as any potential economic uncertainty with respect to the amount and timing of share repurchases over the coming quarters.', 'Our 10.3% CET1 ratio remained well above our required regulatory minimum plus buffers.', 'As a reminder, based on the recent federal stress test, our stressed capital buffer for October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023 is expected to be 3.2%, which would increase our regulatory minimum plus buffers by 10 basis points to 9.2%.', 'Turning to credit quality on Slide 5.', 'Our charge-off ratio remained near historical lows and was only 15 basis points in the second quarter.', 'As we previously discussed, losses are not expected to remain at these low levels and we are closely monitoring our commercial and consumer customers for signs of stress, and we remain very disciplined in our underwriting. Commercial credit performance remained strong across our commercial businesses with only 2 basis points of net charge-offs in the second quarter, which included net recoveries in our commercial real estate portfolio.', 'We also had net recoveries in our consumer real estate portfolios and total consumer net charge-offs declined slightly from the first quarter to 33 basis points of average loans as lower losses in auto and other consumer loans were partially offset by higher credit card losses. Non-performing assets decreased $878 million or 13% from the first quarter. Lower levels of consumer non-accruals were driven by a decline in residential mortgage non-accrual loans due to sustained payment performance of borrowers after exiting COVID-related accommodation programs. Commercial non-accruals continued to decline, and as Charlie highlighted, we are at their lowest levels in over 10 years.', \"Our allowance for credit losses at the end of the second quarter reflected a continued strong credit performance, with an increase that was due to loan growth. On slide 6, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans grew 8% from a year ago and 3% for the first quarter. Period end loans grew for the fourth consecutive quarter and were up 11% from a year ago, with increases in both our commercial and consumer portfolios. I'll highlight the specific growth ogres when discussing operating segment results. Average loan yields increased 19 basis points from a year ago and 27 basis points from the first quarter, reflecting the benefit of higher rates. Average deposits increased $10 billion or 1% from a year ago, with growth in consumer banking and lending, offsetting declines across our other operating segments. The decline in average deposits from the first quarter reflected seasonality of tax payments as well as outflows from commercial and wealth clients.\", 'Our average deposit cost increased one basis point from the first quarter, driven by corporate and investment banking.', 'As I previously highlighted, we would expect deposit betas to accelerate as rates continue to rise and customer migration from lower yielding to higher yielding deposit products would likely increase as well.', 'Turning to net interest income on slide 7.', 'Second quarter net interest income increased $1.4 billion or 16% from a year ago and $977 million or 11% from the first quarter. The growth from the first quarter was primarily driven by the impact of higher rates, which increased earning asset yields and reduced premium amortization from mortgage backed securities, we also benefit from higher loan balances and one additional day in the quarter. We started the year expecting full year net interest income to grow by approximately 8% compared with 2021. Last quarter, we raised our guidance to an increase in the mid-teens.', 'With the market now expecting not only more rate hikes but also larger ones, we currently expect net interest income in 2022 to increase approximately 20% from 2021. And as a reminder, net interest income will ultimately be driven by a variety of factors, including the magnitude and timing of Fed rate increases, deposit betas and loan growth. On slide 8 and noninterest income.', 'This quarter, noninterest income -- this quarter, we included highlighting noninterest income to show that the decline from both the first quarter and a year ago was primarily driven by two cyclical businesses. Mortgage banking, which has slowed in response to higher interest rates and our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses, which a year ago generated elevated gains but recognized impairments in the second quarter of this year due to significantly different market conditions.', \"While all other noninterest income included both positive and negative impacts, it was actually up slightly from the first quarter. The decline in all other noninterest income from a year ago was primarily driven by the impact of last year's divestitures.\", 'Turning to expenses on slide 9. Noninterest expense declined 3% from a year ago as expenses related to divestitures came out of the run rate, and we continue to make progress on our efficiency initiatives. Operating losses increased $273 million from a year ago, primarily driven by increased litigation expense, which included a recovery in the second quarter of last year, and higher customer remediation expense predominantly for a variety of historical matters. Customer remediation matters are complex and take a significant amount of time to resolve and quantify the full impact.', \"While we've made progress, we have more to do to resolve the remaining items. We're halfway through the year. And while we've had higher operating losses than we expected, revenue related expenses are trending lower than expected.\", \"Our results in the first half of the year also reflected the progress we're making on our efficiency initiatives with lower headcount and reductions in both professional and outside services expense and occupancy expense.\", 'We expect to continue to make progress on our efficiency initiatives. Putting all these factors together, we still expect our full year 2022 expenses to be approximately $51.5 billion, as lower revenue-related expense is expected to offset higher operating losses. But as a reminder, we have outstanding litigation, regulatory matters and customer remediations and the related expenses could be significant and hard to predict, which could cause us to exceed our $51.5 billion outlook.', 'Turning to our operating segments, starting with Consumer Banking and lending on slide 10. Consumer and Small Business Banking revenue increased 17% from a year ago, driven by the impact of higher interest rates and higher deposit balances.', 'Our deposit pricing has been stable, but we expect deposit betas to increase over time.', 'As Charlie highlighted, the deposit-related fees were impacted by the overdraft policy changes we started to roll out late in the first quarter, which included the elimination of fees for nonsufficient funds and overdraft protection transactions.', \"Additional changes will be rolled out in the second half of this year, which will further reduce deposit-related fees. Home lending revenue declined 53% from a year ago and 35% from the first quarter driven by lower mortgage originations and compressed margins, given the higher rate environment and continued competitive pricing in response to excess capacity in the industry. After increasing over 150 basis points in the first quarter, mortgage rates increased over 100 basis points in the second quarter. The impact of higher rates also reduced revenue from the resecuritization of loans purchased from securitization pools. The mortgage market is expected to remain challenging in the near term, and it's possible that we have a further decline in mortgage banking revenue in the third quarter.\", 'We are making adjustments to reduce expenses in response to lower origination volumes, and we expect these adjustments will continue over the next couple of quarters. Credit card revenue was up 7%, auto revenue increased 5% and personal lending was up 7% from a year ago, primarily due to higher loan balances.', 'Turning to some key business drivers on slide 11.', 'Our mortgage originations declined 10% for the first quarter, with growth in correspondent partially offsetting the decline in retail originations. Refinances as a percentage of total originations declined to 28%. Average home lending loan balances grew 2% for the first quarter, driven by the fourth consecutive quarter of growth in our nonconforming portfolio, which more than offset declines in loans purchased from securitization pools or EPBOs.', 'Turning to auto. Origination volume declined 35% from a year ago and 26% from the first quarter due to increased pricing competition, credit tightening actions and an ongoing industry supply pressures.', 'Turning to debit card.', 'While debit card spend increased 3%, transactions were relatively flat from a year ago, as increases in travel and entertainment were offset by declines in apparel and home improvement. Credit card point-of-sale purchase volume was up 28% from a year ago with the largest increases in fuel travel and entertainment. The increase in point-of-sale volume and the launch of new products helped drive a 19% in credit card -- 19% increase in credit card balances from a year ago, we remain disciplined in our underwriting and new credit card accounts.', 'Turning to Commercial Banking results on slide 12. Middle Market banking revenue increased 27% from a year ago, driven by higher net interest income from the impact of higher rates and loan balances.', 'Asset-based lending and leasing revenue increased 8% from a year ago, driven by higher loan balances. Noninterest expense increased 2% from a year ago, primarily driven by higher operating costs. Efficiency initiatives drove lower personnel expense with headcount down 9% from a year ago. Average loan balances have grown for four consecutive quarters and were up 13% from a year ago. Utilization rates continue to increase, but they are still not back to historical levels. Clients have increased borrowings to rebuild inventory and to support working capital growth, both of which have been impacted by higher inflation.', 'We also had momentum from adding new clients in middle market banking and similar to prior periods, loan growth was driven by the larger clients. Average deposits declined 2% from a year ago driven by actions to manage under the asset cap. Deposit pricing has been relatively stable, but we expect deposit betas will continue to increase.', \"Turning to Corporate and Investment Banking on slide 13. Banking revenue increased 4% from a year ago, primarily driven by stronger treasury management results given the impact of higher interest rates as well as higher loan balances. Investment banking fees declined, reflecting lower market activity and $107 million write-down on unfunded leveraged finance commitments due to the market spread widening. Average loan balances were up 20% from a year ago, with broad-based loan demand driven by a modest increase in utilization rates due to increased working capital needs given inflationary pressures. Commercial real estate revenues grew 5% from a year ago, driven by loan growth and higher interest rates. Average loan balances were up 22% from a year ago with the disruption in the capital markets, increasing demand for bank financing and line utilization. Markets revenue increased 11% from a year ago, primarily due to higher foreign exchange and commodities trading revenue as clients position themselves for rising rates, quantitative tightening and growing recessionary concerns as well as higher equities trading. Average deposits in Corporate and Investment Banking were down 14% from a year ago, driven by continued actions to manage under the asset cap. There's been more deposit pricing pressure in corporate banking than we've seen in Commercial Banking. On slide 14, Wealth and Investment Management revenue grew 5% from a year ago as the increase in net interest income due to the impact of higher rates and higher loan balances more than offset the declines in asset-based fees, driven by lower market valuations as well as lower retail brokerage transaction activity.\", 'As a reminder, the majority of WIM advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter, so second quarter results reflected market valuations as of April 1st, and third quarter results will reflect the lower market valuations as of July 1st. The S&P 500 and fixed income indices declined again in the second quarter and approximately two-thirds of our advisory assets are in equities.', 'So, there will be another step down in our asset-based fees next quarter. Average loans increased 5% from a year ago, driven by continued momentum in securities-based lending. Average deposits declined 1% from a year ago and were down 7% from the first quarter as clients reallocate cash into higher yielding alternatives. Deposit pricing increased modestly. Slide 15 highlights our corporate results. Both revenues and expenses declined from a year ago and were impacted by the divestitures of our Corporate Trust Services business and Wells Fargo Asset Management and the sale of our student loan portfolio. These businesses contributed $580 million of revenue in the second quarter of 2021, including the gain on the sale of our student loan portfolio, and they accounted for approximately $375 million of the decline in expenses in the second quarter compared with a year ago, including the goodwill write-down associated with the sale of our student loan portfolio. The decline in revenue in corporate was also due to lower equity gains in our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses. In summary, while our net income in the second quarter declined driven by lower venture capital and mortgage banking results, our underlying trends reflected our improving earnings capacity with expenses declining and strong net interest income growth from rising rates and higher loan balances.', 'As we look ahead to the second half of the year, we expect the growth in net interest income to more than offset any further pressure on non-interest income.', 'While we expect credit losses to increase from historically low levels, our consumer and commercial customers are not showing any meaningful signs of stress.', 'As I highlighted earlier, our expense outlook for the year is unchanged at approximately $51.5 billion subject to the risk to the outlook discussed earlier.', 'Finally, our stress test results demonstrated our capacity to return excess capital to shareholders, including the expected 20% increase in our third quarter common stock dividend subject to board approval.', 'We will now take your questions.', 'Yes. Hey, thanks, Ken.', \"First, I'd start with the efficiency program that we've been talking about now for the better part of 1.5 years. And all of that's tracking as we thought it would.\", \"So the core, driving kind of efficiency through the core business lines and operating groups is sort of working the way we thought. When you look at what's happened this year, as you pointed out, operating losses are higher than what we assumed at the beginning of the year. And those things just can be unpredictable at times just as we work through the backlog of items.\", \"You know the accounting standard we work with, right? If we knew about something now, we would accrue for it. If we could estimate it, we would accrue for it. But we're just flagging -- continuing the flag that we still have a pipeline of stuff to work through. And then as you highlighted, as we think about this year, the increases in the operating loss line have been offset by -- largely offset by the lower revenue-related expenses.\", \"And so we still feel good about that $51.5 billion number that we set out at the beginning of the year. And we're going to continue to work through the pipeline of items. And if something is significant in tops, we will be sure to highlight it as we go forward.\", \"Yeah. Maybe I'll just add one or two things, John.\", 'I think as Charlie highlighted, we feel good about where we are. I would just point out, we are not – our G-SIB score is going to stay the same as we go into next year as well.', \"So we don't have another uptick as we go into the beginning of next year.\", \"So that's good. And at this point, we don't feel like we need to build capital from where we are to build a bigger buffer and then we'll just be prudent on buybacks as we go through, and through the next few quarters.\", 'I think, ultimately, the exact progression over the next couple of quarters will be a function of how the Fed moves on rates. But I would think of it as somewhat of a ratable step up quarter-to-quarter.', \"So not -- you won't see some outsized results in one versus the other as we go. And you'll continue to see a little bit of loan growth come through. We think that probably moderates a little bit from what we saw in the first half of the year, but you'll see some loan growth there as well as it steps up. And as you say, I think the industry has seen deposits come down a little bit.\", 'If you look at the latest version of the Fed data, and you can see that in our results as well.', \"Now for us, it's been a little bit of -- you can see the period end balances in each of the segments, and it's been a little bit of reduction in each of them with the lowest percent reduction being in the consumer space.\", \"So that's a good thing. And as you know, we -- over the last couple of years, we've brought down much of our wholesale funding that we've got out there.\", \"And so we've got plenty of capacity to provide liquidity or get the liquidity we need to continue to support clients.\", \"Well, Steve, I know you're really good at modeling this stuff.\", \"So I'll let you do the modeling. But I think as you pointed out, we're going to see step ups, right, as we go through the next -- as we did this quarter from last quarter. And that will continue into the third and fourth quarter. And now exactly what -- it's hard to use one quarter, as you know, it's just run rate for the rest of the -- for the following year. But certainly, the exit rate is going to be a lot higher than even where we are today. And then we'll have to just see what the environment is like at that point how to think about whether that's a clean run rate to build off of, or are there other things they're getting away. And as you can see, over the last -- even over the last three, four, five, six weeks, whatever it's been, the amount of volatility that's out there on the long end and what happens with loan growth, does it keep at the same pace.\", \"And so there's a lot of factors, I think, that go into what 2023 would look. But as you pointed out, our exit rate will be pretty healthy.\", \"Yes. I mean I think that's -- we're not expecting balances to grow much from where they are. And I think we'll see what happens as -- if we see continued outflows of deposits, but as you put it out, like our mix of deposits as we came in this environment sets us up pretty well, and you can see that in the results so far where the consumer deposits are a much bigger percentage of the overall pod than they were just a couple of years ago.\", \"As you think about beta, so far, they've basically progressed as we thought in each of the segments.\", \"And so we really haven't seen much variation to what we thought at this point in the rate cycle.\", \"Now if the Fed does raise rates 75 basis points at the next meeting, now you're starting to get into territory that we didn't see in the last rate cycle -- rate rising cycle.\", \"And so we're going to start to see betas increase from there. And I think that's exactly at what pace and where you need to be defensive or not on the wholesale side of the -- on the commercial side, we'll see, and we're pretty nimble and are able to react to it. But so far, everything has progressed as we thought it would.\", \"And so we're going to keep a pretty close eye on it as we go over the next few months. And I think that will -- this quarter and into the fourth quarter, I think, will give us a lot of interesting data points to know how to think about it over a longer period of time.\", \"Yeah, sure. Thanks, Scott. I'll just bring you through some of the key fee lines just to give you a sense of some of the dynamics, right? So on the deposit side, it's been pretty -- we saw a step down in the quarter, largely a result of the changes we made in overdraft fees. We'll see a little bit more step down as we go through the year, probably more a fourth quarter thing than a third quarter thing, as we implement the additional changes there, but there's -- other than that, there's a lot of stability generally to that line based on underlying activity. We'll see what happens in the market and how that drives the investment advisory and asset based fee line. That's -- it's going to be key to see what happens in the equity and the fixed income markets. And as we bring more stability enters into the market that really supports that fee line. And as you know that’s our single biggest line item as you look at that fees. Investment banking. It's really going to be market driven, but we -- our fees were pretty low, including the small mark that we had on -- in leveraged finance.\", \"And so it's hard to see that going too much lower, but that's really going to be driven by the activity levels. Card spend, we're seeing still good, although it slowed maybe a little in May and June. We're still seeing really good activity in the card space and people are outspending.\", \"So that's helpful. Mortgage banking, as you highlighted, I think, is likely going to come down a little more in the third quarter, but it's off a much smaller base.\", \"You can still have pretty big -- you can have decent sized percentage declines there, but it's still -- it's really small dollars at this point. And then we'll see as the market progresses and how that impacts the equity security side. But -- so I think hopefully, we're getting more stability here, but some of it will be dependent upon what we see in the markets.\", 'I think you can certainly see a little bit more decline from here potentially.', 'I think that’s not an unreasonable expectation. Exactly timing and how that’s going to progress, I think, is hard to predict with any real degree of accuracy, just given the environment we’re in right now. But I think it’s possible, they can be out a little bit more here.', \"Yes, we don't -- you got to think of these as unfunded commitments, not funded, right? So, as you sort of think about them, don't think about them outstanding, thinking about them as unfunded commitments, number one. And you really have to, over time, think about term loans versus high yield a little bit differently. And on the high-yield side, we don't disclose this, but we haven't disclosed the actual number, but it's really small in the scheme of the balance sheet and the term loan side, which generally has a little bit more stability to it and less volatility to it is the bigger part. All these deals are subject to further spread widening, given the environment we're in, for sure. We -- at the end of the quarter, took our best -- used our best judgment to market where we thought the deals would clear. And we'll see how that over the coming months.\", \"Well, I think we've -- as you think about each asset, each type of deposit, to-date, they're tracking pretty close to what we saw last cycle. But you then look at the mix of our deposit base, and that's what's changed pretty substantially since the last go around.\", \"And so if beta stayed the same as last cycle byproduct, given our mix has changed, you would see a lower average deposit beta. But there's a lot to play out as we go through the rest of the year, but in each of the underlying products.\", 'Yes. Sure. Look, and again, it really all depends on what happens in the public equity markets, which is in part driving those declines.', \"So if we see some stabilization, that's constructive. If we see much deeper declines, that's we'll have to evaluate how that impacts these portfolio investments. And obviously, if the market starts to rally, that's even more constructive.\", \"So I think the public equity markets and will be a good guide to how to think about whether or not we have to evaluate whether there's more reductions here or not.\", 'Yeah. I mean, on the training side, it was really good performance in our macro fixed income businesses, commodities, FX, a little bit of rates.', \"And so I think that's all what contributed to it. And we'll see, obviously, the continued performance, there is subject to what we see happening in the markets. It's not – we're not out there taking any kind of incremental risk that we normally take. It's really helping clients facilitate the flow that they've got there, and so we'll see how that goes. And as you can see, it's a relatively smaller number for us versus maybe some others.\", \"As you think about the securities portfolio, I wouldn't assume, there'll be continued gains there.\", 'I think we did do a small, small remixing of our securities portfolio.', 'Some of it was RWA optimization I think selling some UMBS is buying Ginnies that where spreads were pretty tight at the time we did it.', \"You save an RWA you don't give up much yield. And there are a few other minor optimizations we did there.\", \"Yeah. It's not a technology move.\", \"I think he's talking about platforms in terms of the overall sort of the way we operate business.\", \"So there isn't -- it isn't dependent upon a big technology conversion, Betsy.\", \"So -- and then I would just highlight one last thing. Charlie in his prepared remarks, talked about Wells Fargo Premier. That's step one in really helping provide more differentiated and holistic service offering to our affluent clients in the consumer business and the Wealth piece is going to be big part of that. And we already have 1,500 plus advisers in the branch system to do. We already have a great investment platform.\", \"And so we're in the early days, but building out a differentiated service offering there as well, which will be a big part of the wealth businesses going forward.\", \"Hey, Vivek, it's Mike. I'll -- maybe I'll take a shot at that. Look, we've just seen -- I just don't think what we've seen in the second quarter will continue to happen at the same pace. We may get surprised and it will be a little better than we think. But I think at some point, we just feel, as you look at any of the uncertainty that might be there or other factors that are causing clients that use their lines today that just may moderate as we go through it. I wouldn't look at it as some big warning of anything to come. It's just we're being a little -- we're being a little prudent in terms of the way we think about that growth rate and maybe we'll be surprised on the upside a little, but it's just what we're seeing right now.\", \"Not that I would say are super significant at this point. But when you go category-by-category and say, okay, well, spending in the card space continue to increase at the same pace given some of the uncertainty in the economic environment, we'll see maybe commercial real estate, certainly, given what we're seeing in the real estate market there, that appears like it will slow down a little bit again in the second half of the year.\", \"Somewhat driven by what we're seeing in the capital markets side of that business as well.\", \"And so with the slowdown in deals happening and rates rising, that's just as a natural slowdown there.\", \"And so I just think you go asset class by asset class, it just feels as though we'll see a little bit of moderation as we go through the rest of the year.\", 'The loan -- the leveraged finance one, Vivek?', \"I don't have the exact number in front of me. It's not materially different.\", 'Thanks, Latif. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit’s third quarter fiscal 2022 conference call. I am here with Intuit’s CEO, Sasan Goodarzi; and Michelle Clatterbuck, our CFO.', 'Before we start, I’d like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements.

Note that last year, TurboTax Live customer growth significantly benefited from the introduction of the free basic offer.', 'We are proud of the progress against our strategy.', 'However, slower total IRS returns growth is resulting in expected Consumer Group revenue growth of 10% this fiscal year. We now expect overall IRS returns to decline 3% through July 31 compared to IRS returns growth of 3% to 4% the last 2 seasons. This was driven by onetime stimulus filers that did not return this season and overall IRS extensions up significantly year-over-year, with the number of TurboTax customers filing extensions nearly doubling.', 'As a reminder, every point of IRS return growth equals about 1 point of TurboTax revenue growth. We now expect the do-it-yourself category share of total IRS returns to be flat this year below our expectations after growing an average of approximately 1 point per year over the last 2 years.', 'Our hypothesis is that the do-it-yourself category performance was weaker than we expected due to the onetime stimulus filers, approximately 30% of whom were paid customers for us last season.', 'While the last 3 years were anything but normal, over the period, IRS returns grew on average 1 percentage per year and the do-it-yourself category gained an average of just over 0.5 point of share per year consistent with long-term trends.', 'Looking ahead, we expect more normal total IRS returns growth.

Greg has done a tremendous job driving growth for our Consumer business, and I couldn’t be happier for this next chapter for him. Intuit is well known for developing world-class leaders and Greg is no exception. McAfee is lucky to have him. At the same time, I couldn’t be more excited to welcome Varun as the Consumer Group’s next General Manager. With over 7 years of experience leading commercial and product innovation for TurboTax, Varun is perfectly suited for leading Consumer Group’s next phase of growth.', 'We are seeing continued momentum across the entire company given our strategy of being an AI-driven expert platform that is powering prosperity for consumers and small businesses. I’m proud of the team and how we’ve delivered for our customers so far this year. And with that, let’s now – go now to your questions.', 'Yes, sure. Thank you for the question. I’ll break down your question sort of in three parts, given that we are a platform company with sort of a great profile of businesses. I’ll start with tax. I know that was not part of your question, but it’s important to start there, which is tax is sort of very resilient in any type of an environment, and it’s more than 30% of the company’s revenue when you look at both TurboTax and our ProTax business. In small business, there is a flight to digitization to manage your cash flow. And just I would remind us that we are now fundamentally a growth and money center platform for small businesses.', 'And so there is a flight to be able to manage your cash flow on our platform. And the two stats that I would use that are very recent and sort of the here and now, one, our loan business had a record high volume in April. It was 3x higher than it’s been year-over-year. And our charge volume continues to be strong.', 'As of last month and even in this last week, our charge volume has been growing north of 30%. And I use those a couple of stats just more as proof points in terms of the importance of our platform in these unique times. And when it comes to Credit Karma, first of all, on the demand side, I would say that when you get into tougher recessionary times, the demand for the products on our Credit Karma platform actually grows.', 'Now it’s – the discussion is about the supply side. And in fact, with our partners, there is a flight to quality. This is where the power of the data that we have on our customers’ behalf and Lightbox that I’ve been talking about over the last couple of years come into play because with our partners and the flight to quality putting their Credit Karma models on our platform, they are actually able to really get the kind of quality customers that they need.', 'And so it’s just sort of a perfect match between members and partners, which is, by the way, why we saw the strength this past quarter of 48% growth and why the platform continues to be very resilient in these times.', 'So those would be, I would say, the headlines I would share with you about our platform being in need at probably some very unique times where our customers need us most.', 'Yes, great question. I would just start with – there is 86 million customers that are in the assisted category and the TAM is over at $20 billion, and we hit a major milestone this year of delivering $1 billion of revenue with TurboTax Live growing at 30%.', 'So we are in the very early stages of what’s possible in growth and penetration in the assisted category. That is really the long-term really bright spot and future growth for TurboTax, which we are very excited about.', 'You are very welcome.', 'And the only thing I would add is majority of our business, if not most of it, is highly predictable and for the most part, in some areas, it’s subscription, pretty much most of small business, which includes Mailchimp’s subscription.', 'So the predictability is quite high, and we are very sort of data-driven in terms of what we look at daily to see our performance. And as Michelle said, that, combined with the indicators that we see, the demand remains very strong on our platform.', 'Got it. Thank you both.', 'Maybe Keith, I’ll get – I didn’t know it was for Michelle. Michelle, go for it.', 'Well, you know how I am. I just jump in.', 'Alright. Alright. I’ll be quiet.', 'Yes. I’ll tell you, Keith, we are probably more excited today as we sit here than we were even when we made the announcement because now we’re into the work. And I would just say that we are delivering against our expectations and our belief and confidence that is the best is yet to come. And very specifically, we’re focused on creating a growth platform.', 'So in one place, a customer can grow and run their business. And we now have proof points of the things that we’re starting to deliver like the customers and lead tab that’s in QuickBooks, where now we are transferring all of your customer and revenue data into a Mailchimp.', 'The second thing is really looking back the investment in marketing and knowing where to invest has been underwhelming. And that excites us as we look ahead, we’ve got some of our best marketing leadership teams now in Mailchimp and the investments that we are making in terms of one go-to-market strategy, pricing principles and how to invest is that we’re starting to see some green shoots. And with the investments that we’re making, and we’re quite good at these sorts of things. We foresee the financial results will be forthcoming and then last but not least, both going upmarket to mid-market and international.', 'In fact, we will talk more about this at Investor Day, but we have refreshed our international strategy, and a big part of that will actually include Mailchimp because of the fact that half of their business came from outside of the U.S. really with little effort.', 'So that was a long way of saying we’re quite excited about our momentum and we’re very excited about the trajectory of the business and sort of the best in terms of growth is yet to come. And I don’t think you’re going to be able to pick up the performance of Mailchimp through Google Trends.', 'Yes. Very welcome, Keith.', 'Yes, sure. Thanks for the question.', 'First of all, the last recession that we look back on, we actually grew 4%, and this is – I think this was in 2008, and we grew 4% where most of our peers actually declined.', 'And so we perform well in recessionary times. I would also then go on to say we are a totally different company today than when we were in 2008 in terms of the strength of our platform today versus in 2008. One, we now have a platform and by definition, we’re in the cloud, whereas back then, we’re primarily desktop.', 'We are in the cloud where the tailwinds around digitization, a shift to a virtual world, the shift to online, digitization to drive managing cash flow is actually essential for customers. And then you combine that with what I mentioned earlier with our Credit Karma platform where demand is actually higher in recessionary time. And our strength of our data and Lightbox capability makes them a great flight to quality for our partners, which is the current strength that we are seeing.', 'So we’d actually expect to perform better if it was exactly like-for-like compared to 2008. But nevertheless, those were the stats of the past recession and how we performed and we’re in a much stronger position today.', 'Yes. I would say the majority of really the growth is still coming from just the viral word-of-mouth nature of the platform and we are building out the capabilities of the platform.', 'One of the biggest things that we’ve learned now having the business as part of the company, is how much capabilities the platform has the customers don’t know about and how many customers don’t even know about Mailchimp because we’ve really never invested in marketing.', 'And so a lot of what we’re seeing is sort of just continued word of mouth because of the benefits that it delivers. With our investments in the product that I mentioned a moment ago, the investments that we are making strategically in marketing and that will accelerate over time. And then doing so going upmarket and international, we expect that will be accretive to growth as we head into the future. But most of it right now is just, I would say, word of mouth.', 'You are very welcome.', 'First and foremost, I would start with – these are both subscription-based businesses and together, they create magic. A part, one helps you manage your cash flow, which is QuickBooks, the other one helps you actually grow your business.', 'And so I would say that the demand and the strength of the demand, it’s fairly consistent for those customers, whether they are new or customers that have been in business for a while that realize that they have to find a way to market to their existing customers, to be able to grow with them and grow their wallet share and also find ways to market their business on different channels, whether it’s their website, whether it’s on Instagram, Facebook, Amazon, Etsy.', 'And so the demand is consistent. It depends on what you’re trying to do. And all businesses are trying to both grow their business and be able to run their business and manage the cash flow. And what they don’t have is the platform in one place nor do they have the data. And that’s why bringing Mailchimp and QuickBooks together will, over time, actually drive higher retention, a higher expansion of services and wallet share and also higher penetration because what we can do together is hard to do a part.', 'Got it. Thank you. And then turning to TurboTax real quick, when I think of some of my favorite differentiators for the product, I think of just auto importing the investments or TT Live and tool service. But it seems like a lot of the R&D work for those are done.', 'So I guess my question is, where are like the incremental investments going in terms of R&D for TurboTax now? Thank you.', 'First of all, there is no destination to the investments.', 'We are continuing to invest in machine learning and knowledge engineering to not only make the experts that are on our platform smarter so that we can lead how we answer questions through technology and not just through human labor. But two, in terms of how we do the matching and how we ensure that our – really our technology, the bots are engaging and answering the questions.', 'So we’re getting better at this every single day. And we’re going to continue to invest in that area.', 'I think the other thing I would say is around the money. The biggest thing that we learned this year where we’re excited about next year, it’s actually about everything in the assisted segment is about speed the tax is done and speed to my money.', 'And so the integration of Credit Karma into TurboTax where you can now get early access to your refund, that’s another area of investment for us because there is so much more we can do in the experience.', 'So it’s both getting you to a place where taxes are done and experts are smarter in terms of how they help you and also faster access to money and then being able to do that across very specific segments like investors, self-employed, Latinx and over time, the creator economy.', 'So our investments will continue in those areas. And remember, we invested the platform level and at the company level. These are not just investments within TurboTax, and they also benefit us in QuickBooks Live and other areas.', 'That’s awesome color. Thank you very much.', 'You are very welcome.', 'Yes. Thank you, Kash, and thank you for the question. I’ll use sort of tangible here and now answer so it doesn’t seem overly generic. I would just start with saying that we are most important in tougher times than just in good times. And I’ll start with small business. There is an accelerated flight to digitization to manage your cash flow as a small business in these tougher times. And we’re seeing that now. And the example I think I used earlier, but is worth bringing up again is in the month of April, our volume of QuickBooks Capital loans was at an all-time high and 3x higher than the same time last year, where times were much, much better compared to what environment all of us see today. And the other is our payments volume.', 'Just in the last month, in the last week, we are growing north of 30%. This is our payments volume.', 'So I use those as tangible examples just to state that we have truly become a growth platform and a money center for small businesses. And in times like this, we are in need, more than ever, because our capabilities are so different than the last time we were in a recession, because we have all the capabilities with Mailchimp and QuickBooks to grow your business and help you with your cash flow. And I will just maybe pause there with small business, and I will remind us that tax, both our ProTax and TurboTax business is more than 30% of the company, and it’s resilient in very tough times because people have to do their taxes. And then last but not least is demand is higher in recessionary times on the Credit Karma platform. And there is actually a flight to quality. And based on our data and Lightbox capability that’s proprietary, more and more partners are wanting to be on Lightbox because they can actually control the quality of their offers, and it makes our platform even more demand, which is what you saw in the last quarter.', 'And so I would foresee that playing forward, which I think was the nature of your question, we are the best positioned to serve consumers and small businesses in tough times and good times.', 'Yes. I wouldn’t be concerned at all.', 'If you look at our history, when the formations were high, when the formations were low or negative, it really – that’s not the driver of the long-term or short-term health of the business.', 'And so it is not something we worry about. It’s actually not something we track. It’s not something we talk about a lot.', 'And so you all start asking questions, got it.', 'So, I would just say that it is not an area of concern for us.', 'Yes. Thank you for the question. We don’t break out the specifics, but I will take you back to why we love the TurboTax Live platform. One, there is more than 10 million people in the assisted segment that actually a trip and go to another person to help them with assistance within – and these are directional numbers. Within TurboTax, there is probably more than 10 million people that log in, but never actually finish their taxes. And then there is switching that happens back and forth between doing it yourself and then getting assistance. The reason I bring up those three figures is there is actually a lot of sort of movement in the tens of millions in each category and across the category between do-it-yourself and the systems. And it’s all driven by a lack of confidence. Can I do this myself, did I do it right.', 'And so when we look at the TurboTax Live platform and in fact, I would say TurboTax as a whole, that’s why we are now a platform where you can do it yourself, we can do it with you or we can do it for you across the platform.', 'So, our growth in TurboTax Live comes from all those three areas. They are those that switch from assisted, they are those that would have left DIY that now stay with us and vice versa. It helps us with a funnel metrics.', 'So, that is the driver of where we are in TurboTax Live. That has been the driver looking backwards, and it will continue to be the driver looking ahead.', 'First of all, we are really focused on the money benefit for our customers. And for those that live paycheck to paycheck to get five days early access to their refund is really meaningful.', 'So, I am super proud of our team for what they are doing here and – because it really changes lives. With that said, we believe our hypothesis is, one, over time, this will actually help with TurboTax retention. These customers become new Credit Karma members. And then as you know, Credit Karma and the Credit Karma platform, we are really good at leveraging what we know about you with your permission to then really match you to financial products that are right for you and find ways to save money and get out of debt.', 'So, it’s new customers on a platform that already has over 120 million members that over time, as we engage them, we will be able to monetize. We do watch their behaviors. Do they keep the money on a Credit Karma Money, do they drain it, what we can help them with in terms of things they can do with that money to be able to build their credit.', 'So, it’s really – it truly feeds into the network effect of delivering benefits and the customers coming back for more benefits.', 'Yes. Thanks for the question.', 'First, I will start by saying our principles around acquisitions have not changed.', 'For us, it is all about time to market and having a platform that can fundamentally power the prosperity of consumers and small businesses that we serve. And secondarily, we expect excellence from ourselves and our teams, and we expect these acquisitions to be building the kind of momentum that we are building, and we are – we have a set of mechanisms within our Intuit operating system where we monitor very closely our progress against the deliverables, and I mean the product and marketing deliverables and the talent on the team and their engagement to really ensure that things are on track. And really, everything with both of these acquisitions is about acceleration. We only integrate as long as it accelerates.', 'And so we have a very I would say, good playbook in terms of how to make acquisitions. And in both cases, when you look at Credit Karma and Mailchimp, we bought the capabilities and the incredible talent because they do things that we are not great at and there are things we do that they are not great at and together as a family, we can create magic.', 'So, with all of that said, it doesn’t accelerate or decelerate what we are looking at from a time-to-market perspective, they are both on track in terms of our expectations. And we are very discrete in terms of how we allocate mind share and resources to both of these assets. And frankly, the biggest hindrance for future acquisitions is how good their management team is. It is not our mind share or our resources.', 'So, that’s the way we think about it.', 'Yes, it’s a really good question.', 'First of all, I would tell you, having sort of experimented with our TurboTax Live basic offer is a good experiment and it worked. The biggest thing that I would tell you that we learned in this – particularly this last year is what really matters is speed to your taxes done with an expert and speed the money. And that is an area where we are doubling down going into next year because the majority of these customers, they want their taxes done right by an expert or if you do it for them and they want access to their money as soon as possible, both of which we can deliver on.', 'And so really, in that context, folks that use an assisted method generally have more complex situation. And we would expect, over time, the higher SKUs that we have to play a bigger role when it comes to TurboTax Live.', 'That’s helpful there. And Sasan, just to the earlier point you made earlier on the call just on international. Have you seen any change in terms of trends of new customer growth or even top of funnel with either QuickBooks and Mailchimp when you look internationally versus maybe more in the U.S.?', 'Yes. What is consistent is what I have shared before, which is, I would say, U.S. and Canada, and I will just use COVID as an example, coming out of – we are not out of COVID, but coming out of sort of the world shutting down, bounce back much faster than the other countries that we are in. In the UK, in Australia and France, there has been so many sort of start, stop, start-stop, that it’s impacted the sort of building momentum in that country. And I don’t mean to us, I just mean how consumers and small businesses thinking about managing their financial life.', 'So, they are starting to bounce back, but they, for sure, are tracking behind the U.S. and Canada. And again, I will say that what it really excites us looking ahead is the possibilities to help customers grow their customers in small business with Mailchimp. That will be a bigger part of our future as we roll out our strategy and game plan and we believe that, that will be over the long-term, accretive to our growth.', 'That’s helpful. Thanks for taking my questions.', 'Yes. Thank you very much.', 'Yes. Sure, Scott. Well, first of all, I will start with the headline, which is there could be. But now let me give you more specifics with the guidance and what we are talking to you about is for our fiscal year, which is through the end of July. And I will start at the top. The IRS returns through July, we are observing that it will be down three points, and it’s driven by stimulus filers that didn’t come back. About 30% of them were actually paying customers and IRS extensions being up. And in our base, they are nearly doubled.', 'And so we have made some assumptions in terms of what will happen through July. And of course, we will talk to you all more as we talk about our guidance for next fiscal year because we have not made those estimates, and we won’t communicate it today because our focus was what we communicate to you through July. But certainly, the extensions, most of those customers at some point come back, and – but we have not estimated what that will be after July. And we do expect just – so it said again that IRS total returns will be more normal next year because, in essence, this year, we are digesting what happened in the last 2 years because of all the stimulus filers and we would expect it to be more back to the normal flat or up as we look into the future.', 'Let me start with the latter part of your question. When we look at the assisted category where there is more than a $20 billion TAM, and by the way, there is another $10 billion TAM, which is business tax that we have not talked about.', 'So, in total, it’s $30 billion. TurboTax Live is $1 billion.', 'And so we have got a lot of runway. And as you have heard me talk in prior years, we are sort of in the early days, and we got a 10-year run here, hopefully, now that we have divulged how big TurboTax Live is, you can see how much runway we have.', 'So, there is a lot of runway there. There is also a lot of runway in our underpenetrated segments.', 'We are truly just getting started with Latinx, self-employed and the investor segment because we are actually under-shared in those segments based on all the data that we see.', 'And so when we look at those segments, which is both do-it-yourself and in the assisted segment, we also have an equal runway. And we believe, down the road, the creator community – the creator segment will continue to become a larger part of those that choose to do taxes, and that’s an area where we will be focused over time as well.', 'So, that was a long answer to your short question.', 'I think the headline I would leave you with is, yes, there is a runway for sure. And it’s a multiyear runway in all of those areas.', 'Yes. Thanks for the question. And I will start with the first part of what you led with. When we look at the last 3 years and even more historically, IRS returns has been up about 1% and the DIY category has grown about 0.5 point.', 'And so when you look at the last 3 years with all the anomalies, that also holds true. And the way we keep score is our share of the total IRS returns with respect to just now the platform that we have, where you can do it yourself or we will do it for you on the other spectrum. But specifically to answer your question, we do believe over time that the DIY category will continue to grow just as it has grown historically.', 'So, we do believe that this is just I would say, a year where we are digesting all of the anomalies in the last 2 years.', 'We have over 120 partners on our platform and these partners, they are big and they are small. And with that as context, are always experimenting and adjusting both in good times and not so good times, their credit cycle and they jump between bands, whether they are more interested in those that have a credit band below 620, which is subprime or between 620 to 700, which is prime or near prime and then, of course, anything over 700, which is prime. And the point is, based on our platform and the demand on our platform and the supply on our platform, we see very good supply across all of the bands because of the focus areas of the partners.', 'And so that drives the strength that we saw this last quarter, and we would expect it going forward in context of our guidance.', 'Yes, Brad, great question because we are actually – we are done with our 3-year and 1-year plan and the way our cycle works is while we are in the heat of delivering this year, we finish our planning for next year. We look at a few things. One, we look at secular trends. We look at facts and figures on our platform.', 'So, the secular trends are what I have mentioned earlier, which is a shift to using virtual solutions, an acceleration to online and omnichannel and an acceleration to using digital money platform.', 'So, we look at secular shifts and we look at the facts and figures around the secular shifts. We then look at all the things that actually happened on our platform and our share. If I just use a couple of examples, we have over $1.5 trillion of invoices that are generated on our small business platform. But as we shared last Investor Day and of course, this number is bigger now, our payments volume was over $90 billion.', 'And so you look at – that’s a very low share. When you look at our share of the assisted category in tax, very low share, when you look at our share of financial products on Credit Karma, credit cards, personal loans, very low share.', 'So, we look at data around our share and our performance around our share. And then we will also look at economic factors like unemployment, like default rates, like projections around the economy. By the way, we are the best projector of the economy because of the data that we see on our small business platform.', 'So, we look at all of those things. And then the way we put in – put together our plan is sort of worst case, middle case, best case. And that’s how we manage the company. And by the way, this is something that we are quite good at. And then we manage based on the data that we see, we managed to ensure that we are protecting our long-term investor investments while we deliver for today for our customers.', 'So, that’s a little bit of a snapshot in terms of how we think about it.', 'So, I will. Hey, thank you, everyone, for making the time. Thank you for all your wonderful questions.', 'As I said earlier, I am super proud of our employees across the company and our partners, and it’s a real privilege and honor to be able to serve our members and customers in these unique times.', 'And so all of you be safe, be well, and we will talk to you soon. Thank you.', 'For the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we delivered revenue of $5.6 billion, up 35%, including 6 points from the addition of Mailchimp, GAAP operating income of $2.4 billion versus $1.9 billion last year, non-GAAP operating income of $2.9 billion versus $2.2 billion last year, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $6.28 versus $5.30 a year ago and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $7.65 versus $6.07 last year. On May 4, we entered into a settlement agreement with the State Attorneys General regarding our advertising practices related to free tax preparation. This resulted in a $141 million onetime charge in our fiscal third quarter. Under the terms of the settlement, we admitted no wrongdoing.', 'We are pleased to put this issue behind us so we can continue to focus on delivering innovative solutions for our customers.', 'Excluding the settlement charge, our fiscal third quarter GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin would have been 250 basis points higher, and GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $0.37 and $0.38 higher, respectively.', 'Turning to the business segments, Consumer Group revenue was $3.2 billion, up 32%, reflecting the earlier IRS tax filing deadline this year. I’m proud of our execution this season as we expect to gain share and grow our average revenue per return. There are four primary drivers of our consumer business. This data reflects our expectations through July 31, 2022 versus the prior year through July 31, 2021.', 'The first is the total number of returns filed with the IRS. We now expect total returns to decline 3% this year, below our original expectations. Every point of IRS returns growth equals about 1 point of TurboTax revenue growth.', 'The second is the percentage of those returns filed using do-it-yourself software.', 'We expect the DIY category share of total IRS returns to be flat by the end of the year, also below our expectations.', 'The third driver is our share.', 'We expect our share of total IRS returns to expand approximately 1 point this year, and our share of the DIY category to be up 2 points excluding users of the TurboTax Free File offering in prior year periods. The fourth is average revenue per return, which we expect to increase this year, driven by a mix shift to TurboTax Live and our premier offering used by investors as well as fewer free customers.', 'As a result of the weaker IRS returns, we now expect total customer growth of 1%, including TurboTax Online paying customer growth of 8% this year.', 'We expect the base of customers paying us nothing in our commercial-free offering to decline 11% this year to just over 13 million from over 14 million last year. This was driven by onetime stimulus filers that did not return this season, approximately 30% of whom we’re paying customers. We now expect Consumer Group revenue growth of approximately 10% in fiscal 2022 versus our prior guidance of 10% to 11%, reflecting the decline of total IRS returns I mentioned earlier.', 'We continue to expect Consumer Group revenue growth of 8% to 12% long term.', 'Turning to the ProConnect Group, revenue grew 10% in Q3, reflecting a shift in the timing of the IRS tax filing window year-over-year.', 'For the full year, we now expect ProConnect Group revenue growth of 4% to 5%. In the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 42% during the quarter or 20% on an organic basis, excluding $257 million in revenue from Mailchimp. Online Ecosystem revenue grew 67% or 31% excluding MailChimp.', 'With the aim of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within the Small Business and Self-Employed Group is threefold: grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally.', 'First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online Accounting revenue grew 32% in fiscal Q3, driven mainly by higher effective prices, customer growth and mix shift.', 'Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue, which includes Mailchimp, payroll, payments, capital and time tracking, grew 121% in fiscal Q3.', 'Excluding MailChimp, online services revenue grew 28%. MailChimp revenue recorded in online services was $257 million in the quarter, and this was in line with our expectations. Within payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects growth in payroll customers and a mix shift to our full-service offering. Within payments, revenue growth reflects an increase in charge volume per customer and ongoing customer growth.', 'Third, we continue to make progress expanding globally. Total international Online Ecosystem revenue grew 221% in fiscal Q3 on a constant currency basis and 29% on an organic basis, excluding MailChimp. We believe the best measure of the health and success of our strategy is online ecosystem revenue growth, which we expect to grow better than 30% organically over time. This is driven by 10% to 20% expected growth in both customers and ARPC. Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 3% in the third quarter. QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew mid-teens, driven by strong customer growth and price increases. Longer term, we don’t expect the desktop business to be a growth driver for the Small Business and Self-Employed Group.', 'Moving on to Credit Karma, revenue grew 48% to $468 million in Q3, another record revenue quarter, driven primarily by growth in average revenue per monthly active user. On a product basis, revenue growth was driven primarily by personal loans and credit cards and to a lesser extent, auto loans.', 'We are developing the emerging verticals by focusing on innovation with Credit Karma Money, which we believe is key to growing the frequency of visits over time.', 'As Sasan shared earlier, we saw a more than tripling in the number of TurboTax Online customers who deposit their refund into their Credit Karma Money account this year. We remain excited about the opportunities ahead.', 'Turning to our financial principles, we remain committed to growing organic revenue double digits and growing operating income dollars faster than revenue.', 'As we have shared before, as we lean into our platform strategy, we see the opportunity for margin expansion over time. We take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investment greater than 15%.', 'We continue to reallocate resources to top priorities with an emphasis on being an AI-driven expert platform. These principles guide our decisions and remain our long-term commitment.', 'Our first priority for the cash we generate is investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. We consider acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product road map. We return excess cash that we can’t invest profitably in the business to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends. We finished the quarter with approximately $3.9 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet. We repurchased $489 million of stock during the third quarter. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.68 per share, payable July 18, 2022. This represents a 15% increase versus last year.', 'Moving on to guidance, we are raising our full year fiscal 2022 revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance to reflect the momentum we’ve seen throughout the year in the Small Business and Self-Employed Group and Credit Karma.', 'Our updated fiscal 2022 guidance includes revenue of $12.623 billion to $12.674 billion, growth of 31% to 32% and including Mailchimp as of November 1 and a full year of Credit Karma, up from prior guidance of 26% to 28% growth.', 'Excluding $765 million to $770 million in Mailchimp revenue, growth of 23% to 24%, up from prior guidance of 18% to 20% growth; GAAP earnings per share of $6.95 to $7.01, down from prior guidance of $7 to $7.17 – excuse me, $7.16. We now expect a GAAP tax rate of approximately 20% this year, up from 18% previously, non-GAAP earnings per share of $11.68 to $11.74, up from prior guidance of $11.48 to $11.64.', 'Our fiscal 2022 guidance includes the impact of the $141 million onetime charge related to the State Attorneys General settlement.', 'Excluding this charge, our expected GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin would be approximately 110 basis points higher in fiscal 2022, above our prior guidance. Expected fiscal 2022 GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share would be approximately $0.37 and $0.38 higher, respectively.', 'Our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 includes a revenue decline of 8% to 9%, reflecting the earlier tax filing deadline this year versus last year, GAAP loss per share of $0.53 to $0.47 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.94 to $1.', 'You can find our full Q4 and fiscal 2022 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. With that, I’ll turn it back over to Sasan.', 'Hi, thanks for the question. Yes, as we see the macro environment unfolding, one of the good things that Sasan has shared is we really don’t see a lot of – have not seen a lot of impact to our business. It is one of the things that we are continuing to look for. But given the way our business works, the platform that we have, and really the need that small businesses and consumers have in times like these, even more for our products and our platform, we don’t anticipate seeing an impact.', 'And so we’re always looking and to make sure to see what’s happening, but we haven’t really changed anything with our forecast at this point in time in any – as you can see with our guidance that we’ve given.', 'That’s exactly right, Keith. Because of the nature of the charge, the one-time, it’s not an impact to the underlying structural part of our business. We wanted to make sure that you could see really what is the business driving.', 'And so yes, it actually would have been higher. It would have been the $0.37 higher on GAAP and $0.38 higher on non-GAAP for EPS for the full year.', 'I’m sorry, I thought it was for me.', 'Except that I lose my voice and can’t talk. But no, you know we have our financial principles, first of all.', 'So our financial principles to grow revenue double digits and grow operating income faster than revenue.', 'We haven’t set out any target for what that margin expansion might look like over time. But we do see that it is possible because of the benefits of being on – having the platform that we do.', 'And so besides being able to innovate more quickly and deliver for our customers, we do continue to see those opportunities as you’re seeing this year that we can really leverage key services and capabilities across our business whether that be in technology or customer success or sales and marketing, we do continue to see an opportunity there, although we have not given any type of specific range of what that expansion might look like.', 'Katy, thank you, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us today. UnitedHealth Group ended the second half of the year with sustained momentum as we execute on our objective to serve more people more effectively with connected high-quality care.', \"For that, I want to thank our 360,000 colleagues. It's their unwavering commitment to our mission and their hard work and support of the people we serve that makes all of this possible.\", \"As a result of the strong performance at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare, we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share outlook for the year to a range of $21.40 to $21.90 per share. Comprehensive value-based care is a central theme of our growth strategy, helping more patients and care providers transition from traditional fee-for-service to a value-based orientation. We aim to drive better and more consistent care outcomes at lower overall cost, often for people who are among society's most vulnerable with multiple chronic conditions, limited income and unmet social needs. Optum Health and Optum Rx's clinical platforms span a continuum of care settings, from virtual to post-acute, in-clinic and at home, enabling our care teams to meet patients' unique needs by providing personalized connected care.\", 'Our approach helps patients stick with their prescribed care programs, allowing them to spend more time in the comfort of their own homes. The high consumer satisfaction with this comprehensive and consumer-focused approach is evidenced, for example, by a Net Promoter Score of 80 for the 1.5 million people served by our Dual Special Needs Plans. We again delivered growth across our health benefits offerings this quarter.', \"As you might expect, right now, our Medicare teams are finalizing offerings for this fall's open enrollment, focused, as always, on delivering more value, stability and predictability for seniors. Throughout the year, we gather extensive consumer broker and market feedback to continually improve our products.\", 'Our approach is grounded in providing deep customer engagement, high-touch service and access to the best care. The benefits of this approach are striking. People served by Medicare Advantage spend about 40% less out of pocket than those participating in fee-for-service, which translates into savings of about $2,000 each year for seniors, most of whom are on limited income. And compared to traditional fee-for-service, Medicare Advantage plans devote up to 30% more in resources to primary care and perform up to 50% more preventative screening and testing services for their seniors. The response among seniors in our plans is positive. Plan satisfaction ratings have risen by 450 basis points over the past 5 years, nearly twice that of the industry. Consumer satisfaction is best demonstrated by the almost 3.4 million additional seniors who have chosen our plans over the same period. Meanwhile, in our domestic commercial health business -- benefits business, over the past 12 months, we have grown to serve over 250,000 more people as a result of innovation in and expansion of our products, including our digital-first offerings. To continue driving affordability in areas of greatest need, we are announcing today an important initiative from UnitedHealthcare, supported by Optum Rx. Starting in 2023, there will be no co-pay, $0 out of pocket for several critical medicines on our preferred drug list for UnitedHealthcare Group fully insured members. Included are medicines such as insulin, epinephrine for severe allergic reactions, and albuterol for acute asthma attacks.', \"While this is an important step for vulnerable people's health, the larger and longer-term cost containment of drugs depends upon manufacturers restraining and lowering the list price of their products, which is a fundamental driver of costs.\", \"We will continue to use our capabilities to do everything we can to lower out-of-pocket costs for consumers, building on past actions, including point-of-sale discounts. Stepping back and looking across each of our 5 growth areas, you'll see a common theme: The deepening of our relationships with the consumers served by Optum and UnitedHealthcare. Throughout 2022, we've been rapidly expanding and accelerating investments in capabilities to reach and serve a broader base of consumers ever more effectively. This includes further enhancing our digital experiences to help consumers find trusted, health-related information and drive greater engagement with our direct-to-consumer platforms.\", \"Now, I'd like to turn it over to Dirk McMahon, our President and Chief Operating Officer, to share more about these efforts. Dirk?\", 'Before the Q&A, let me underscore a few key points.', 'First, the strong momentum throughout our business. The people we serve are continually seeking value, high-quality care at fair cost, and our colleagues across Optum and UnitedHealthcare are raising the bar every day.', \"You see that manifested in our business performance and the strong growth in our core platforms, double-digit growth across the Benefits businesses, a growing revenue backlog in Optum Insight, robust growth in our pharmacy services and expansion across Optum Health. We see tremendous opportunity ahead, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver our long-term 13% to 16% earnings per share growth objective and further advance our mission to help people live healthier lives and to help make the health system work better for everyone. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions. One per caller, please.\", 'A.J., thanks so much for the question.', \"So first off, before I hand this to Brian Thompson to give you a few thoughts, we've been super pleased with the progression, particularly across the benefits business, as you've seen in the report this morning. But certainly within our E&I business, the commercial business had a very strong year. And I think the team have worked extremely hard to understand the kind of pressures you're describing as employers are obviously concerned about managing their own cost environment and how we make sure that the benefits availability for their employees are appropriate. Really, I would say, take just this opportunity just to emphasize how important the role of a company like UnitedHealthcare is here. Because as we all know, we're in a more inflationary environment. The role of UnitedHealthcare to help deliver affordability, affordable healthcare coverage to the employees of all of those companies that rely on it is super important. And maybe with that, I'll hand it to Brian to give you a little bit more sense of how things are playing out.\", 'Brian, thanks so much. And A.J., thank you again.', 'Next question, please.', 'Justin, thanks so much for the question.', \"Before I ask John to maybe comment a little bit on the business cost evolution and then Brian, I think will give you a little bit of perspective of what they're seeing in terms of hospital conversation, just a couple of step back observations maybe I would offer here.\", 'First off, as we look across the overall business, we are seeing tremendous growth opportunities and tremendous potential for us to invest behind those. And you see that picked up in some of the increase in investment levels that you see in the quarter this time around.', \"I think that's an incredibly positive sign of the forward potential of the overall organization. John will talk a little bit more to some of those in a second.\", 'I think in terms of 2023, we are not going to get into a ton of detail on how we are thinking about pricing. But as always, we are very, very respectful of the kind of underlying phenomena within the cost trends of the environment.', \"Of course, that includes a sense of where COVID may or may not be. And I think we have all learned to be deeply respectful of something like a pandemic and the uncertainties it can present. And even in the last few months we have seen that play out a little bit. And of course, respectful of things like inflationary trends in the environment and all of that plays into how we think about these things. Maybe just to give you a little bit more depth on the first part of your question, I'll pass it to John, and then maybe John, you could pass it to Brian, just to finish off on the second part.\", 'Justin. Appreciate it.', 'Next question, please.', 'Ricky, yes, great. Ricky, thanks so much for the question.', \"Before I ask Heather to make a few comments on that, I think one of the overwhelming census that we see around Optum Rx is the really strong growth and the bringing on board of very significant new clients. And of course, that, as you know, brings with it a kind of front-loading investment phenomenon as you gear up for supporting that, and that's one of the reasons why you see this lag between the revenue growth and the earnings growth. And maybe to give you a little bit more of a sense of all of that and other aspects, Heather?\", 'Great. Thanks, Heather, and Ricky, thank you for the question.', 'Next question, please.', \"Matt, thanks very much for the question. I mean, I think not to be too disappointing too, but I don't think you'd be too surprised that we don't generally comment on ongoing legal processes. And I think in this case, that certainly applies.\", 'So not really in a position to be able to give you too much information on that, but certainly appreciate the question.', 'Next question, please.', \"Scott, thanks so much for the question. And listen, let me start off by saying we really believe that enhancing and building high-quality care provision in the home is going to be a key feature of the future. And the more that that can be linked to other aspects of care, so for example, physician clinic, virtual and the rest, it's very much a central focus of our Optum Health development.\", \"And so the bringing together of LHC within the overall Optum organization is really important to us, and we're very committed to that transaction. We believe it really is going to be a significant enhancement of the quality of care that can be delivered. And we think we can really -- it can really contribute towards improved value-based delivery for patients.\", 'I think, as is always the case, making sure that the incentive system is appropriate to drive the right kind of care is really important.', 'So I hope very much over time that CMS and others continue to see the value of home care and that, in fact, the support is given and the signals are given to continue to increase the development of high-quality care in the home environment.', \"And so we'll see how that plays out. Honestly, we are committed to this agenda very much because we see it as a strategically critical way of extending better care to folks in homes. And you have to remember, Scott, some of these folks can't get out of their homes. I mean, this is really -- this isn't kind of elective for them. They need -- we need to find ways to get more help to them. And as you know, we've got a long history in this in areas like house calls, which have delivered amazing health assessment and preventive direction to millions of people, and this is another big step for us to extend.\", \"So we're optimistic about this. We hope very much that CMS and others will continue to send signals of support through the way in which they choose to invest in this arena, and we'll see how that plays out during the rest of the year. Thanks so much for the question.\", 'Next question, please.', \"Lisa, thanks so much for the question. And I think UHC supported by Optum Rx are doing the completely right thing here to bring $0 co-pay and $0 out of pocket on some critical meds. And you've got to think about the consequences of folks who are unfortunately affected by the conditions that these meds address. If they don't get the meds when they need them, they're going to end up in the emergency room or worse. And that brings with enormous personal human consequence and, of course, cost.\", 'And so we believe this is a really appropriate place for us to lean in and to address that.', 'In terms of -- before I go to Heather to talk about specifically Optum Rx selling season, I just want to step back for a second. I just want to let you know, Optum is in the middle of a record selling season across the board.', 'If you look at the first 6 months of Optum, it, of course, including Optum Rx, but also the other 2 businesses, that we are in a record selling season.', \"So this is a really significant period for us in terms of the fit of the products and services that we're offering across the marketplace.\", \"One of the reasons why you've seen a step up our investment profile in the business is because we're seeing such a strong pickup in our services. And maybe with that, Heather, you could address specifically what you're seeing in Optum Rx as you think about selling seasons into '23? And maybe also just touch on the value-based care aspect that Lisa described.\", \"Heather, thanks so much. And Lisa, I think you're really right to focus us on this value-based piece. And as Heather just said, rather than it being an Optum Rx kind of standalone agenda, it's very much an Optum agenda, right, in terms of how we build value-based care propositions. And of course, you've seen that very substantially within -- in the primary care, kind of holistic approach that Optum Health is leading on.\", \"You'll continue to see us prospect experiment and invest in areas like behavioral health and in areas like oncology, and these are going to be important areas for us to solve. Right now, I'd say those are early day opportunities. But as you think about where the burden of cost and complexity sits in the healthcare environment, those are the kind of places where we need to make progress, and we are. And you should expect to hear much more from us on that over the next 2 or 3 years. Lisa, thanks so much.\", 'Yes, Josh, great question. Really appreciate it. And we continue to see a very strong performance in our senior book of business.', \"You see that continued progression toward 800,000 folks joining us this year for the first time. That's really important, continued market share growth. And all of that is built on the stability of the service offering that we're giving. And I think the experience that the seniors are taking. But you're totally right to ask the question about where next. And maybe Tim Noel, you could speak to that?\", \"Tim, thanks so much. And I think maybe there was a little glitch with Tim's mic at the beginning of his comments.\", 'So I hope very much you were able to hear him, and certainly hear the latter part of his commentary. And I think the sense of urgency and depth of thinking around innovation for our senior members and where that service can go over the next several years is really substantive, and you should continue to see us be super active in that space. Josh, I really appreciate the question.', 'Next question, please.', \"Great questions, Kevin. I'm going to ask John in a second to talk to the margin progression opportunity. But maybe first, Dr. Decker, Head of Optum Health, might speak to the whole dynamic around physician recruitment?\", 'John, thank you very much. Kevin, I appreciate the question.', 'Next question, please.', 'Yes. Well, thanks so much.', 'Let me hand it straight to John.', 'Thanks, John, and thanks, Whit.', 'Next question, please.', \"So I'll ask John to make a few comments on this in a second, but I'm glad you saw that substantial continued deployment of our capital to grow the business.\", \"As you know, a key part of our long-term growth strategy is, of course, organic and complemented by bringing on board new businesses and teams who can supplement what we have. And there's nothing more powerful to that agenda than building out the value-based care piece.\", 'Now we believe in both Atrius and Kelsey-Seybold organizations.', 'We have amazing teams, people, organizations which have got real character, history, personality of themselves that we think is going to really add to the diversity of the company and bringing with it a tremendous amount of skills and perspective. And as you know, a number of them already -- in both cases, they have developed themselves some significant thinking around value-based care, so the fit is really good.', \"Of course, when you bring in new organizations, there's typically a further in process before they fully contribute, and I'm sure that will be the case here as well. But really, we continue to be extremely active in how we sensibly think about deploying capital, and we remain very optimistic about our ability to do that. But maybe go a little further around valuation perspective, John?\", 'Absolutely. Gary, thank you so much for the question. We just have time for one last question.', 'So final question, please, operator.', \"Nate, thanks so much for the question. I'm maybe going to go to Brian in a couple of minutes just to give you a little bit of what he's seeing and what is kind of reflected in his membership. But listen, obviously, we all see the inflationary pressures around us, and we all know that that has -- that really focuses people's minds on how they prioritize their spend and investment. What it really means for us is we have to double down on getting a great deal for them.\", \"We have to use our capabilities to get the very best quality care available at the most affordable cost. And whether that's through the PBM, whether that's through the UnitedHealthcare negotiations with the rest of the medical environment. That's a really important role we're stepping into play, and we're going to continue to lean into that very much.\", \"Now then, it speaks to really being astute around understanding how within the consumer experience, some things are more problematic than others. And I'll call out one of the things we're announcing today to eliminate those co-pays on for people who are in really vulnerable situation. This is the right time to do that, to help those folks who are struggling, and we know that we need those folks to make sure they fill their prescriptions properly. And if there's anything caused by the inflationary environment that might hold that back, there's going to be really bad downside there. And we don't want that to happen.\", \"So we will lean into that. I'd call out things like virtual, call out things as you think about much more digital engagement. Call out choice. I mean, giving consumers more choice. The more pressure there is in the environment, you've got to lean into it. And that's why, as an organization, we have over the last 2 years really doubled down on our commitment to consumer strategy across the board. Core capability of this company going forward will be consumer capability. And that's an area where you will see us continue to talk about, invest in, build, innovate and we hope really lead in terms of moving the consumer to the center of thinking in healthcare. And maybe just to finish off, Brian, would love to get your perspective on what you're seeing from your very significant membership.\", 'Thanks so much. And Nate, thank you very, very much for that question.', 'We certainly appreciate your time and attention today. And I hope what you heard is the story of growth and focused execution.', \"As our strategy continues to generate momentum across our businesses and advance our mission on behalf of every person and every community, we're privileged to serve. Really grateful for your attention this morning. Thank you so much for your questions. We look forward to following up as usual with any further questions you might have offline. Thanks so much, and have a great day.\", \"Thank you, Andrew. Picking up on Andrew's comments, I want to provide you with a little more color on the progress we have been making on our growth strategies. This progress is evidenced by -- is evidenced in our work to serve more people through value-based arrangements and to deliver better care.\", 'We are well along in our goals for the year. This expansion has significant implications for clinical quality and consistency. MA patients in value-based arrangements with Optum Care physicians are more engaged in their care, with adherence to wellness checks running 5 points higher than Medicare fee-for-service patients, helping to deliver a nearly 20% lower hospitalization rate. Further, Optum Care COPD patients served in our value-based arrangements have 80% higher medication adherence rates than Medicare fee-for-service patients, contributing to about 60% fewer respiratory complications, enabling people to avoid emergency room visits. Clinical results like these are a small part of the track record we have built in delivering value-based care at a substantial scale for years now, and what gives real urgency to our work to expand access to such care.', 'We also remain committed as an organization to improving access by driving down the cost of healthcare through applied technology.', 'For example, we are investing hundreds of millions of dollars to enhance the technology backbone of healthcare. Areas such as platform rationalization to reduce unnecessary complexities, greater end-to-end eligibility management for a more seamless customer experience, and a common platform to facilitate a consistent clinical experience for our consumers and providers. These investments will ultimately lead to an enhanced end-to-end service experience, lower overall operating cost and greater value for people we serve. A simpler experience is at the center of our work on the integrated consumer card developed by our Optum financial services team.', 'We have seen great consumer response within our initial pilot groups. The simplicity of combining all benefits, even healthy food purchases onto a single widely-accepted card has been a differentiator with consumers. Based on this initial work, we intend to introduce the card to all our individual Medicare Advantage members in 2023.', \"Another key element of our work to improve experience is the optimization of consumer transactions. We know members need and expect timely information at their fingertips, and I'm pleased to report they are responding well to our digital offerings for everything from understanding their coverage to completing a virtual visit. Digital engagement has jumped 170% among Medicare members during the last couple of years.\", 'Lastly, in pharmacy services, we are very focused on improving quality of care and access for consumers by driving pharmacist-led offerings.', \"We are on track to have nearly 700 community pharmacies by the end of the year and continue to increase the integrated community pharmacy footprint in our clinical locations. With that, now I'll turn it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex.\", 'As Andrew noted, we entered the second half of this year with strong growth momentum.', 'First half revenues of over $160 billion grew 13% compared to last year. Performance was well balanced, with double-digit growth at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. To begin, let me touch briefly on the care patterns we have observed so far this year. Principally, we have seen what had been a balanced relationship between COVID and non-COVID care activity over the past couple of years diverge modestly, with the latter not returning quite as rapidly with lower levels of COVID care.', 'We also continue to see some variation in underlying care patterns, with certain areas remaining below historical levels.', 'For example, pediatrics and emergency department. And others coming back more fully, such as the levels at which seniors are obtaining important preventative care. In recent weeks, we are seeing rising COVID-related hospital admissions but with a lower average length of stay compared with earlier periods.', 'As always, we watch closely for longer-term health impacts on people due to care, which might have been deferred during earlier periods. Thus far, we are still not seeing patterns, which indicate shifting acuity. There are, of course, many reasonable theories about what is driving the current environment, and they are all no doubt interesting. But here is what we are actually doing. Consistent with the long-standing practice at UnitedHealth Group, our primary intent is to ensure people are getting the care they need and to help them in that process as much as we can. We remain, as always, highly respectful of medical cost trends and how they can evolve rapidly, and we will continue to position our offerings accordingly.', 'Moving now to the businesses. Optum Health revenue grew by over $4 billion or 32% in the second quarter. Revenue per consumer increased 30%, led by growth in patients served under value-based arrangements. Earnings from operations rose 24% even as we accelerated investments in our care delivery practices to support value-based expansions.', \"We also saw strong contributions from Optum's ambulatory surgery centers, which continue to advance the scope and complexity of procedures performed in these optimal settings, all while delivering a superior patient and surgeon experience and high-quality clinical outcomes.\", 'Our centers have nearly tripled the number of high-acuity joint, spine and cardiovascular procedures performed compared to just 2 years ago. Care providers increasingly recognize the benefits these centers offer, and consumers place high value on the care quality and experience, with an NPS consistently in excess of 90. Optum Insight revenue grew 11% year-over-year. The revenue backlog was $23.6 billion, growth of $2.3 billion compared to last year.', 'We continue to drive technological advancements, applying artificial intelligence and machine learning more deeply in high-value knowledge-based services, including an expanding suite of information technology and data analytics offerings. Optum Rx revenues grew 10% to nearly $25 billion, reflecting continued strong sales results and execution in the core PBM as well as our growth in our pharmacy care services. These vital and expanding care offerings serve and improve the health of people, including in such areas as our high-touch specialty services where we tightly monitor and track the effectiveness of complex treatments.', 'Turning to UnitedHealthcare. Revenue grew by a strong $6.6 billion or 12%, with contributions from all our businesses. In our offerings for seniors, we continue to expect to serve up to 800,000 additional people within Medicare Advantage this year. About 3/4 will be an individual and group Medicare Advantage and the remainder in Dual Special Needs Plans. This puts us on track for our seventh consecutive year of share gaining growth in Medicare Advantage. People served by our Medicaid offerings grew by 180,000 in the second quarter. At this point, we anticipate the impact to Medicaid enrollment as a result of state redetermination activities will be experienced next year.', 'We continue to prepare resources to help people find uninterrupted access to appropriate coverage as this transition occurs. We added 80,000 new people in domestic commercial plans during the quarter. Within that, fully-insured commercial offerings grew by 60,000 from the first quarter of this year, with balanced growth across group and individual fully-insured offerings. Of note, some 90% of the growth within our individual and family plans was among people who chose a plan featuring convenient and cost-effective access to virtual visits.', 'Our capital capacities remain strong.', 'Second quarter cash flows from operations were $6.9 billion or 1.3x net income, and we continue to expect full year cash flows of about $24 billion. In the first half of this year, we returned nearly $8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. In June, our Board increased the dividend by 14%, and we deployed more than $7 billion in capital to enhance our care delivery capacity and consumer strategies to improve outcomes and experiences for the people we serve and for the benefit of the broader health system.', 'As noted earlier, based on this growth outlook, today, we increased our adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $21.40 to $21.90 per share.', \"Now, I'll turn it back to Andrew.\", 'Sure. Good morning, Justin.', 'Just a few thoughts, and in particular, maybe we will look at some of the observations really from the quarter from the first half and what we have seen because this influences really what you are getting at and asking how our thinking is developing.', \"So, you heard in my prepared comments talked about that we had typically seeing a very balanced relationship between COVID care and non-COVID care over the course of the last two years, and that's what shifted a little bit here in recent months that the lower level of COVID care. And let's put that in the second quarter, probably about 1/3, the number of inpatient admissions as compared to the first quarter. It was not as quickly accompanied by a higher level of non-COVID utilization.\", 'So, that was an important kind of underlying factor here that we saw in recent months.', \"I think the other important thing here is, and as you look across care broadly, we've gone longer really between intervals and COVID hospitalizations that any other point since the pandemic now.\", 'So that further illuminates the core underlying non-COVID care patterns that we are seeing also.', \"So helping illuminate what's going on underneath all of that.\", \"I think the other point that I wanted to speak to that we are seeing, we've been very encouraged that we are seeing some pockets of care moving towards more normal levels. Ones that we would say are kind of bellwethers for future care, an important -- for example, super important for us. Annual wellness visits among our Medicare patients, they're back at pre-pandemic baseline. That's very important for us in getting them the care they need.\", \"First fill prescriptions are trending above baseline a little bit, so we're seeing people get some care they need. We're seeing important pickups in some preventative care such as colonoscopies, also those now getting back to baseline.\", \"So all that kind of influencing in terms of how we think about the future. We got to make sure people are getting the care that they need. We've seen the greatest response really in our senior populations.\", 'I think some of that is our ability to get into their homes to influence that care and to get them into that. And certainly, back to your kind of core fundamental in how we think about the future, yes, enormously respectful of the outlook for future impacts from COVID hospitalizations.', \"Here we are sitting in a period where we're seeing COVID hospitalizations rise again after kind of pausing since January.\", 'So super respectful in our outlook towards how that might progress throughout this year and next, and the potential for that to continue to be somewhat variable and to accelerate again. Brian?', \"Good morning, Kevin, it's John here.\", \"So considering the growth in Optum Health and the earnings progression that you should expect out of that, the primary focus continues to be on expanding our capabilities for value-based care, that build out. These investments, as you know well because you've looked at this for a while, are made well in advance of any revenue impact that we get from bringing those physicians on.\", \"As we look at our pipeline, so when I talk pipeline, there are 2 ways to think about it. It's both potential future ads. But when I'm talking about it now with you here, I'm talking about even our existing base of clinical care delivery capabilities and where we have to build out that capability in terms of future value-based expansion. We're still quite early stage in that, which is why we hang in this 8% to 10% margin range for Optum Health, view being here that there is a decade ahead of build for us, so. And just when you look at our existing pipeline and what that can drive in terms of strong double-digit top line growth for many years as we bring this on. And the importance, in particular because of the value it brings to the patients we serve, of continuing to invest in these value-based capabilities.\", \"So as we build along this, you'll see as we try to do this, we try to -- we look to deliver in this 8% to 10% margin range. And I expect that to continue just because of these deep investments and still considering this very early innings, third inning in terms of the build that we'd like to see looking ahead for care delivery.\", \"Good morning, Whit. Yes, within the quarter, we actually took -- we realized some losses as we reposition the portfolio a bit here, looking out to the future, try to get that all teed up for the environment we're in right now.\", \"And so when you look at that, the quarterly progression, which I believe that's what you're focusing on, I'd call it some of the realized losses we chose to take in this quarter.\", \"As it relates to valuation perspective, I mean, our pipeline and our conversations as we expand in care delivery, these are multiyear conversations that we have. Often by the time we are able to partner with another care delivery organization, we've probably been in conversations with them for 5 years. Super long pipelines, development processes, relationships, understanding the organization. That is us understanding their organization, them understanding us. These go on for quite a long period of time.\", \"So with that perspective there, there's probably a little bit less volatility than you might expect in terms of as we pace out and we think about valuations in this business and where we would have stepped into it maybe a number of years ago where we are now. And even if you look towards a public market and such, this just don't manifest quite as quickly. But they also kind of on the other side, they weren't manifesting as quickly.\", 'So I would call it a little less impactful at this point and juncture, but the key point that I think we focused on is, these have been multiyear conversations and relationship builds for us as we move into these, and typically not a 6-month process.', 'Yes. Thanks for the question, A.J., and I appreciate that lead in, Andrew. Most of these conversations have been around innovation and how do we continue to drive value-based solutions in the form of product design. That has really been the central theme throughout.', 'We have showed up to the market with some new ideas around virtual care.', \"You've heard about that with our partnership with Optum, both in terms of product design, as well as broader access beyond medical integrated with behavioral, et cetera, and how we really enable the consumer. High deductibles have often have been a part of the equation for a long time, but Bind really puts that consumer in the driver's seat where they're able to choose what coverage they want with pre-service guaranteed costs. And that really resonates in the marketplace. And most importantly, for employers, it not only provides great quality, but lower price points.\", 'So I would say the conversations have been less around staffing and employment levels and more around value. And these examples of products have really resonated.', \"Yes, John, I think you summarized that well. I might just add on inflation. Obviously, as you well know, Justin, we priced to our forward view of cost, that includes inflation. We're certainly respectful of what we're seeing in terms of labor cost with our provider partners. And as you might expect, obviously, with long-term agreements, there will be more impact in 2023 than 2022, just as a function of time and how we renew these contracts.\", 'So certainly respectful of that dynamic and environment. Thanks.', \"Sure. Thanks for that, Andrew. Maybe to put it in 2 zones. Macro, I think Andrew hit it right in that macro environment. It's really around virtual care and around emergency department use. We've seen, obviously, virtual care increase and emergency department use go down.\", \"As I think in the particular, again, back to that concept of consumer and choice, it's around product design, Bind being our best example when we can put that consumer in the driver's seat where they can choose site of service and optimize both their cost and quality, they do. And when you couple that with a high-performing network, obviously, you get the benefit both of the unit cost as well as that consumer choice.\", 'So those are the greatest examples that I can see really emerging in this environment.', \"So as Andrew said, really strong growth this year, and you see that as a result of new client growth and the membership that we've brought in and the direct Optum Rx as well as the UnitedHealthcare book. And you're seeing that in the revenue, you're seeing that in the scripts volume, we see strong utilization, and you also we're seeing that in the earnings growth. With respect to investments, which do impact margins in the quarter, but we will see a return on those through the year and in our long-term plan, I point you to actually 4 things. Number one, those client investments that Andrew talked about. Number two, we talked to you about the new businesses. We've referenced Genoa that we continue to expand into new sites so we can serve more individuals in underserved communities. But I'd maybe point you to 2 additional ones that I think provide some great context where we're investing for the year. That's, number one, with our existing clients and even being responsive to those or prospective clients in our PBM, it's moving very urgently with innovation, like Brian's seeing on the UnitedHealthcare side. To develop products today that address specialty drug costs that are high and rising in addition to consumer affordability. Building on the tools that we've already, I think, delivered significant value.\", \"Our specialty tools has delivered over $1 billion of value over the last 2.5 years, and we're not done. We're working urgently to bring more services and products.\", \"So that's happening real time in the quarter, and those investments will pay off. And then the last one I'd point you to are those -- are our pharmacies.\", \"So our pharmacies are fast growing. We're seeing that impacting our top line growth and in our earnings. But you'll see us not just invest in our operations, and we've talked to you about that before, and in our digital experience. But I'm most excited about the fact that we're also integrating the service.\", 'So putting the pharmacist first.', 'We have over 7,000 pharmacists that work hard every day not just to serve and sync meds, but to help our individuals navigate, educate and guide people through our best-in-class capabilities.', \"And so really, integrating those pharmacies with the pharmacist-first and a service-first model is one of our biggest investments in the quarter, and you're going to see a return on that through the rest of the year, but I think it's also going to pay off in the growth of those pharmacies and better service to individuals that need us most.\", \"As Andrew said, strong selling season across Optum Rx is enjoying that as well. And the way I think about that, first of all, it came off a really strong '22 season. Sitting where we are today, 2 ways to think about it.\", \"The first is client retention. We're going to be in the high 90s again this year with most of the book in right now. With respect to new business activity, based on sales activity, including finalists and win rates right now, we're ahead of where we were at this time last year. And I really think that's the result of the real-time innovation. We're working again with our clients now to bring them services today. We're not waiting. We're not waiting for other market factors or the environment to make us innovate and drive down cost, and that's showing up.\", \"I think we have the best client management team and responsive client management team in the industry, and that's paying off for us.\", \"So I think we're going to be very busy again in 2023. That's going to require some investment. But we're going to be very busy with another 2023 year serving our clients. With respect to value based, I guess, I think about it in 2 respects. We're seeing better -- we're seeing definitely more interest and pressure from our clients. And we're also seeing more engagement from our clients to engage in the elements of value-based care and to incorporate pharmacy, including specialty pharmacy, into those constructs. The role for us to play is, number one, to ensure that our pharma partners are bringing the most affordable value-based and clinically appropriate drugs to drive those results. But the other thing is that we bring tools real time that integrate products, with treatment protocols. We work very closely with Optum Health, and particularly with most -- with many of our Optum Care prescribers and providers, to experiment with these tools and services that will help prescribers make the right choices.\", 'Our plans and plan sponsors to be able to have more predictability in their services and for us, to be an important piece of that value-based shift.', \"So you'll continue to see us invest there, and I think we'll see even more -- the PBMs being a bigger piece of driving value-based care and integrating pharmacy.\", 'Hey, good morning, Josh. [Audio Gap] selling season for Medicare Advantage. Throughout the selling season [Audio Gap] number and also seeing, as John talked about, really great engagement.', \"I think about senior market [Audio Gap] continuous agenda of innovation is super important [Audio Gap] Dirk talked about the UCARD, which is something that makes our benefits easier to use, more simple for members to understand on and experience. But beyond that, we'll continue to bring forth consistent innovations that make the member experience easier for people. Things like the digital experience, more personalized member experiences as well.\", \"I think another theme for the senior population will continue to be to -- on expand at-home services. That's really important.\", \"I think we've historically thought of the center of care for seniors to be in the physician's office. More and more, though, that's becoming something that needs to occur out of the home given mobility channels, challenges for folks, the vulnerability of this population, bringing care into the home is absolutely essential to the delivery of high-quality care.\", 'So those are the big themes.', 'For me, looking forward is continue to advance the at-home capabilities for seniors and continue to innovate, make using benefits easier, more understandable, simple, affordable.', 'Yes. Kevin, thanks for the question. Absolutely, we are seeing continued growth of our physicians in Optum Health and Optum Care. What we’ve found is that physicians are increasingly attracted to the value proposition that we offer them, which is less clerical burden and more focused on doing the work that they love, which is providing clinical care.', 'Moving physicians to value-based care paradigms is especially appealing.', \"So you're seeing us appeal to large groups like Atrius and Kelsey that have recently joined Optum Health, as well as doctors coming straight out of residency.\", \"So we're tracking nicely towards our growth agenda of adding 10,000 physicians and advanced practitioners during the year, and look forward to following up with you at the investor conference to share those numbers.\"]\n"]}],"source":["with open(\"full_company_data\",\"rb\") as f:\n","  string_all_data_doc =  pickle.load(f)\n","print(string_all_data_doc)  "]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":192,"status":"ok","timestamp":1667285975232,"user":{"displayName":"Ishan Borker","userId":"10021432107981899854"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"aYj0Z5aFJYeL","outputId":"c8af9501-da8e-4fed-d8b5-72f11bf1f387"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["['Good morning and thank you for joining us.',\n"," 'On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stephen Williamson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Operator, we’re ready for Q&A.',\n"," 'Great. Thanks Puneet. Operator, we will take one more question.',\n"," 'Thank you, Raf. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today for our second quarter call.',\n"," 'As you saw in our press release, we had another excellent quarter. We delivered outstanding financial performance.',\n"," 'Our core business is performing very well, that strength is broad-based across all our businesses.',\n"," 'As I reflect on the quarter, I am very proud of the team’s great execution and the resulting share gain we saw across our business.',\n"," 'Our ongoing success is propelled by our proven growth strategy and our PPI Business System, which is a differentiator for us and enables operational excellence within the company.',\n"," 'You will see this in our second quarter results and increased outlook for the year.',\n"," 'So, let me first recap the financials.',\n"," 'Our revenue in the quarter grew 18% year-over-year to $10.97 billion.',\n"," 'Our adjusted operating income was $2.61 billion.',\n"," 'Our adjusted operating margin in the second quarter was 23.7% and we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS performance, achieving $5.51 per share.',\n"," 'Let me now give you some color on our performance by end market. Starting with pharma and biotech, we had excellent performance in this end market, delivering growth in the mid-teens. We saw excellent growth across all businesses serving these customers, highlighted by our bioproduction and pharma services businesses.',\n"," 'We are continuing to benefit from our trusted partner status that we have earned over many years with our pharma and biotech customers. In academic and government, we grew in the mid single-digits in the quarter. We saw strong growth in biosciences and chromatography and mass spectrometry.',\n"," 'Turning to industrial and applied, we grew in the low double-digits for the quarter. We saw very strong growth in electron microscopy, chromatography and mass spectrometry and our research and safety market channel.',\n"," 'Finally, in diagnostics and healthcare, revenue was 20% lower than the prior year quarter. In this end market, the core business saw strong growth led by immunodiagnostics and microbiology.',\n"," 'During the quarter, the team continued to execute well to support customers’ COVID-19 testing needs. Overall, excellent performance across our end markets. And as I reflect on this quarter’s performance, we continue to deliver very differentiated core business growth. This was driven by three factors: the market conditions were good; our team managed lockdowns in China extremely well; and we had outstanding execution from our global team, resulting in meaningful share gain.',\n"," 'Let me now provide an update on the progress we made in executing our proven growth strategy. The investments we have made and are continuing to make across the company are fueling growth and generating strong returns.',\n"," 'Our growth strategy has enabled another quarter of excellent performance.',\n"," 'As a reminder, our strategy consists of three pillars: developing high-impact innovative new products; leveraging our scale in the high growth and emerging markets; and delivering a unique value proposition to our customers. I will start with innovation. We launched a number of new products across our businesses to further strengthen our industry leadership and enable our customers to accelerate scientific breakthroughs. I will highlight a few of these.',\n"," 'We have an outstanding American Society for Mass Spectrometry Conference, where we showcased new instruments, consumables and software to advance our customers’ work. These included the Thermo Scientific AccelerOme automated sample prep platform, which simplifies workflows for proteomic researchers by eliminating a range of previously manual steps.',\n"," 'We also launched the cloud-based Thermo Scientific RDO software platform, which integrates functionality and data across multiple chromatography and mass spectrometry instruments to simplify application-specific workflows, helping scientists share information with each other and labs around the world and speeding the development of new diagnostics and therapies.',\n"," 'In addition, we launched the Thermo Scientific Direct Mass Technology mode for our industry-leading Q Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometers. This technology allows for the characterization of complex and large biotherapeutics, which were previously challenging to interpret. In our biosciences business, we launched the Gibco CTS TrueCut Cas9 Protein that supports genome editing for applications such as CAR-T cell therapy research. Emerging therapies like CAR-T are providing new hope in treating cancer. And in Specialty Diagnostics, we launched the Phadia 2500+ series in the U.S., a high-throughput instrument for allergy and autoimmune diagnostics to help further improve lab efficiency. These new products and many others will make a significant difference for our customers and drive future growth for our company.',\n"," 'Turning to our high growth and emerging markets, we are really thrilled with our team’s progress.',\n"," 'You may remember that we called out China as a potential Q2 headwind, because of the COVID-19 lockdowns in the country. Obviously, the lockdowns were very severe, but I am so proud of the way the team responded. They powered through demonstrating the relevance of our offering amid the crisis and delivered over 20% growth. That was the result of a very strong core business, the benefit of deep relationships we have with our customers, and our support for local COVID-19 testing.',\n"," 'So overall, it was a great quarter and one that clearly demonstrates our growth strategy continues to deliver outstanding results.',\n"," 'The third pillar of our growth strategy is our unique customer value proposition.',\n"," 'Our capabilities enable our customers’ ability to achieve their own goals for innovation and productivity. To be the best partner for our customers, we continue to enhance our capacity and capabilities.',\n"," 'Let me share a couple of examples. In our flagship facility for cell culture media in Grand Island, New York, we just completed a capacity expansion to support customers’ research, drug development and production applications. And in our lab chemicals business in Geel, Belgium, where we have our primary Continental European distribution center for lab chemicals, we just completed a major expansion of the facility to support the strong growth that we have been delivering. I have had the opportunity to visit both sides a number of times and it’s really exciting to see the ongoing strength in customer demand that’s driving the need for this investment. These are just a few reflections on the way we are supporting our customers by further strengthening our capabilities and value proposition.',\n"," 'Now, turning to capital deployment, I’d like to share some of the other steps we have taken to further strengthen our customer value proposition and build our future.',\n"," 'We continue to successfully execute our disciplined capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders.',\n"," 'We are very pleased with the performance of the PPD acquisition. The business is performing very well, delivering strong core revenue and earnings growth. In May, at our Investor Day, we increased the revenue synergy outlook by $100 million to $250 million in year 3 and the cost synergies in that year by $25 million to $100 million and the synergy opportunities continue to be incredibly exciting. I just had a chance to meet with the clinical research commercial organization and I am so impressed with the team and the opportunity that they see for enabling the success of our customers going forward. The combination of capabilities is really resonating with customers and we are seeing strong momentum in the business.',\n"," 'All of this is leading to business performance well ahead of the deal market. The acquisition of PPD is another example of how our capital deployment strategy is creating customer and shareholder value.',\n"," 'Turning now to an update to our ESG initiatives, we released our latest Corporate Social Responsibility Report. This report details our progress and disclosures for all of our key ESG initiatives and is a great example of how we are continually working to enhance our reporting and disclosure using internationally recognized reporting standards. It’s great to see the progress detailed in the report and also reflecting the progress we have made through our commitment to ESG over many years.',\n"," 'For this quarter, I will highlight the progress we continue to make on our goal to reduce our carbon footprint.',\n"," 'As part of our efforts, we continue to transition to renewable energy is sold at onsite rooftop solar power at key locations to reduce our consumption of electricity produced with fossil fuels.',\n"," 'We are also working with our suppliers on their climate performance goals which will ultimately have an impact across our value chain.',\n"," 'As a leader in ESG, our commitment to progress is ingrained in everything we do and we look forward to updating you on our progress as we go forward.',\n"," 'Now, I’d like to review our updated 2022 guidance at a high level and then Steve will take you through the details.',\n"," 'We are meaningfully raising our full year guidance.',\n"," 'We are increasing our revenue guidance by $700 million to $43.15 billion, which would result in 10% reported revenue growth over 2021 and we are raising our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.28 to $22.93 per share. This higher outlook primarily reflects the strength of our core business and additional contribution of COVID-19 testing revenue, which are more than offsetting the increased foreign exchange headwinds, demonstrating how well we operate with speed and scale to enable our customer success and navigate dynamic macro environments.',\n"," 'So, to summarize our key takeaways from the second quarter.',\n"," 'Our outstanding results in Q2 highlight the benefits of our proven growth strategy, our PPI business system and our extraordinary team.',\n"," 'Our business is performing very well and we are gaining market share. The PPD acquisition is generating strong returns.',\n"," 'We are really well positioned to continue to differentiate ourselves for all of our stakeholders. And the team is doing an excellent job navigating the dynamic times we are living in.',\n"," 'All of this has enabled to raise our outlook for 2022 and further solidify our incredibly bright future. With that, I will now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?',\n"," 'Hi, Jack. Good morning.',\n"," 'So Jack, I guess the first thing is business performing extraordinarily well, right? We have broad-based strength.',\n"," 'As I look at the companies that have reported, we’ve done very well from a top line perspective.',\n"," 'So I feel good about how we’re performing. Bookings performance was very good.',\n"," 'So if I think about what are we seeing in our business, we’re seeing very strong strength, right? In terms of the macro, obviously, when you read the papers or wherever information source, lots and lots of challenges in the world. And in the last quarter, we articulated some of them and how we factored some of that into the thinking for our outlook.',\n"," 'And so what do we think about sensitivity? This company is incredibly well positioned to navigate whatever the world throws at us, right? And the industry in and of itself is attractive as well as sensitive economically than many.',\n"," 'We are very well positioned within it, and we have tremendous momentum. When I think about – if we see a downturn, and we’re not seeing the signs of one, but it doesn’t mean that there won’t be one.',\n"," 'We have the benefit of a track record of dynamic of navigating dynamic times and exiting those periods really an incredibly strong industry leader. We benefit from an experienced management team, an incredible team around the world, a proven growth strategy in a PPI business system, which gives us great operational discipline.',\n"," 'As you know, we’ve taken a number of actions over the last few years to strengthen our position in the end markets we serve. And today, relative to the recession and the great financial crisis, we have less industrial exposure.',\n"," 'As a reminder, about 30% of our revenue going into the last recession was industrial. Today, it’s about 13%. And Pharma and Biotech is much larger, and that has been the least economically sensitive of the end markets, and that represents just under 60% of our revenue. And when I think about our mix, we’re more service and consumables oriented than we were then. Then, it was 65% of our revenue. Today, it’s 82% of our revenue.',\n"," 'So the company is performing well.',\n"," 'Our end markets are good, and we will manage through whatever the world throws at us. And you see that in the results, right? You see that in the – FX got meaningfully more challenging for all global companies, and we’re able to power through that and deliver an increase in our guidance.',\n"," 'So from a capital deployment perspective, I really wanted to do the deeper dive on the progress of PPD, and we did a large acquisition in December, right? And the first thing we have to demonstrate is that we’re great owners and operators of the businesses that are part of the family, and that’s always our number one priority, and that business has performed great. And we have an active pipeline. And when I think about how valuations have come in many sectors that creates opportunities, right? So we’re actively engaged as we always are and we’re well positioned to capitalize on the M&A opportunities that will be out there in the landscape.',\n"," 'Patrick, good morning, thanks for the questions.',\n"," 'So, when I think about bioprocessing, I always like to frame it in the context of how we serve former biotech, right? The market will level up, it’s very attractive.',\n"," 'We have a leading presence, and we’re really well positioned to serve those customer base. And you’ve seen us deliver really strong growth. When I think about production, right, or bioproduction, as a reminder, we have two major activities that we have within our company.',\n"," 'We have our bioproduction business, which is the leading presence in cell culture media, single-use technologies and a rapidly growing purification resins business as well as our pharma services business, which is both drug substance and drug product for biologics. And you see us play with the monoclonal antibodies, viral vectors, cell therapy, plasmid, sterile fill, finish all part of that.',\n"," 'So it’s a large portion of our total presence in serving pharma biotech. Outstanding quarter, right, when I look at – and that was both across the services business and bioproduction. When I look at how others have done and reported, I feel very, very good about our performance. And the outlook here is really positive. When I think about your question on the COVID vaccine therapies, our outlook for the year is $1.5 billion. That’s the same as it was in Q1. We did just over $400 million of revenue in Q2, which was right in line with our expectations. It brings us to a little bit over $900 million at the halfway point of the year.',\n"," 'So we feel good about our role in supporting our customers’ activities in vaccines and therapies. That’s part of our core revenue growth.',\n"," 'So over time, when there is less demand for those capabilities, we will transition that well to other applications, which we do all the time.',\n"," 'I’ll start with the customer comments, and Stephen will go through his thoughts.',\n"," 'We’re incredibly transparent with our customers and a partner to enable their success.',\n"," 'So we’ve had very constructive discussions, and we’ve operated with transparency and has allowed us to get an appropriate level of pricing.',\n"," 'Sure, Mike. Thanks for the question.',\n"," 'So when I think about the 13% core growth – the 14% core growth for the first half, really strong momentum in the business and very broad-based, right? So that’s exciting. And when I look at how the industry is reporting, we’re faring very well.',\n"," 'So I’m proud of the team’s efforts.',\n"," 'So some of the highlights, geographically, the team is doing incredibly good job in China.',\n"," 'So that’s one lens. End market lens, pharma biotech going incredibly quickly, right, with mid-teens growth.',\n"," 'So that’s another of lens. And then the way you framed it, from the businesses perspective, analytical instruments is doing very well. It’s going to see the 13% growth in the segment, great performance in electron microscopy and chromatography and mass spectrometry.',\n"," 'Our channel is performing well, pharma services. And then while it doesn’t it’s in the core.',\n"," 'Our PPD acquisition has performed very well. We’ve obviously had the benefit of seeing a couple of industry participants report and that business is going well. And to be candid, it’s pretty much broad-based cost business. I haven’t mentioned either. It’s not the – I didn’t say something to us not doing well. The team is really humming right now.',\n"," 'So, Mike, I guess a few thoughts on 2023, right. And obviously, I am looking forward – I am actually doing it every day, it’s not that. But when we get to January, I will be looking forward to giving you the – give you the update on sort of what we think for the year, right, so in the details. What we don’t know now, right. And it’s just nobody knows is what’s the macro environment, right. Is it – was it like the first half of this year, well, phenomenal, right, or is it different, and so we will appropriately set the context for 2023, when we get there. But I think there are a couple of things that are worth saying at this point in time to at least help you think about it. One is the core business, right. It’s going to be large, right.',\n"," 'We are growing the business faster this year than we had outlined in the long-term model.',\n"," 'So, I mean the jumping off point in 2023 is we are going to have a bigger business. And that’s core that drives earnings power and all of those things.',\n"," 'We will have an appropriate growth range based on how we see the world at that point in time.',\n"," 'We will figure that out as it gets closer. And then Stephen might – do you want to comment on FX and because I know that the movements have been enormous, and you might want to frame how to think about that for next year. But I feel great about how the core business performed.',\n"," 'Yes. And Mike, when I think about the 7% to 9% growth, that’s the long-term sort of average we worked through.',\n"," 'So, it can vary in a given year, as this year, obviously, is above that, it can be within and it can be different, just depends on the measure we use is, are we delivering really good performance, right. And it’s going to be in the context of what’s the environment.',\n"," 'So, that’s going to wait until January. Thanks for the questions.',\n"," 'So – when I think about the business in China, the team really did an excellent job I think really difficult circumstances. They basically had a month in the Shanghai region to basically get the business to really incredible performance in June.',\n"," 'So, I am very proud of that. We had good growth in the core business, much better than we expected. And a nice chunk of the overdrive in COVID testing was in supporting the local activities.',\n"," 'So, we did a really good job there. We don’t sell our assays there, but we do sell our instruments and in our reagents to support local demand.',\n"," 'So, we had strong core growth and a meaningful response in China, actually larger than we typically have in China for COVID testing. The way I think about the outlook is it should be a good market in the second half of the year. I have no doubt there will be some level of COVID disruption. What that will be, when it will be, where it will be, hard to know. But just given the zero COVID policies, there will be bumps on the road. But the team knows how to navigate that, and I feel like we will get through that period effectively. And there could be some headwinds here or there, but nothing that we see at this point in time in China. It looks very strong.',\n"," 'So Rachel, thanks for the question. Pharma market has been very strong.',\n"," 'One of the questions because as our investors and analysts ask the question. I asked the team about are there patterns, trends, anything that is jumping out. And it’s actually been broad-based strength, right.',\n"," 'We are seeing good growth in the various sub-segments within the customer base.',\n"," 'So, I feel like the momentum is strong. Orders were strong. There is always company-specific challenges right. There will be companies that have bad data, bad report out or a company that’s going to a cat and whatever [ph]. And we help those companies navigate those times. We help them drive productivity and accelerate innovation, and those things. But we continue to see strong momentum in pharma and biotech. Thanks for the questions.',\n"," 'So, Matt, thanks for the question.',\n"," 'One of the things that’s just been phenomenal is the speed at which we have been able to get meaningful authorizations that clearly synergy work, meaning the benefits of bringing the combination together and we have had several of the larger clients that have worked historically, very closely with us, already select us to do business with them in clinical research.',\n"," 'So, we have had meaningful wins there.',\n"," 'We are also seeing some really interesting momentum in some of the smaller companies, well, so it’s not just the large ones. But that concept of leveraging the existing relationships and the trusted partner status is working really well. And I think it was really cool that we were able to increase our synergy outlook by $100 million back in May, really just at that point was just six months after the close. I mean it’s a big number. And the team is not stopping there. They are focused on closing business, building a very large authorizations backlog and growing the business incredibly strongly for the long-term.',\n"," 'So, I think it’s very positive. And we have earned a lot of trust over many years, and we are going to help our customers develop their medicines and do that cost effectively and rapidly so that they can really benefit patients.',\n"," 'So, it’s a very exciting time in terms of our clinical research momentum.',\n"," 'So, Matt, thanks for the question.',\n"," 'So, Europe actually had a good quarter, right. And it’s so to say that with down double digits. And effectively, we had a very significant COVID-19 testing comparison.',\n"," 'So, embedded under that, the core business grew very strongly, actually.',\n"," 'So, the demand has been good, and we saw really good market conditions in bioproduction, the research and safety market channel will be examples business did really well in Europe.',\n"," 'So, what I saw in Q2 was strong. There is obviously lots of challenges in Europe. When we put that sentence, it’s not a Thermo Fisher comment or an industry comment with pressures on energy prices and certainly, lots of challenges with the war in Ukraine.',\n"," 'I think Europe will clearly be lumpy from a global economy perspective. But given our mix of business, which is very similar to the company average, we have a very large pharma biotech presence in Europe. And when you take out the COVID testing, it represents a little under 20% of our revenue.',\n"," 'I think we will navigate that well.',\n"," 'Again, in terms of the industrial and Applied, we obviously continue to see good momentum.',\n"," 'We have a good position in serving semiconductor materials science. Those are – have been strong. The Applied markets funding has been fine.',\n"," 'So, that sector continues to be good. There is obviously global macroeconomic concerns, but generally, things continue to be strong. And we do have a different mix than we were much smaller in terms of the percentage of the total is so a different mix.',\n"," 'We have more raw material science mix than we did back in the last recession.',\n"," 'Puneet, good morning.',\n"," 'So, Puneet, we had very strong performance in the quarter. Bookings were very strong as well.',\n"," 'So, that gives us – that’s encouraging in the second half.',\n"," 'We also have a very large backlog, right.',\n"," 'So, that also gives us some visibility to the second half as well, it gives us the confidence in the very strong outlook we have for the year from a core perspective.',\n"," 'So, the signs are very good. And we are launching some amazing technology. That makes a huge difference. Like ASMS this year, I give obviously a deeper dive than normal, really affecting the workflow across a number of key applications for mass spectrometry, fantastic in terms of the feedback and momentum in the business. The same thing is true in our electron microscopy business is very strong.',\n"," 'So, I think we are very well positioned going forward there.',\n"," 'Puneet, thanks for the question.',\n"," 'So, we picked a couple of really specific examples this quarter to highlight. I picked the example of Grand Island and Geel. And those capacity expansions or demand has been so strong for so long that we need to expand our capacity just to be able to support our future growth, right. It’s just – it’s a different type of example, which is you deliver great results year-in, year-out, at some point, you expand your network to facilitate the gross strategy. Other of the expansions have a little more just adding new capabilities. They have been coming online this year and will continue to come online next year.',\n"," 'So, it’s a mix. And it’s exciting in terms of in – we have really – we brought on new capacity in our self to finish. That was really the enabling the Moderna relationship expansion outside of COVID and that’s really a 2023 example. And we have a number of other examples like single-use technology that we will be bringing online and we will continue to bring them on.',\n"," 'So, it’s a mix, but we feel good about the blend of investments and how they will fuel our growth strategy going forward.',\n"," 'So, on the FX and customer impact, the movements have been very rapid and relatively recently.',\n"," 'So, there hasn’t been a lot of customer discussion, it’s really about where the rate is going to settle. And it’s also going to depend a lot on what the alternatives are. If everybody is a U.S. based cost company, then it is what it is.',\n"," 'If you have different where are we producing, where others producing and get into some of those dynamics.',\n"," 'So far, it’s been a non-issue. And we have dealt with this. The fact that I pulled out a playbook from what we had in the years past where we had rapid moves in the rates and we know how to navigate that environment a lot. Steve?',\n"," 'So, as you have heard this morning, really an excellent first half of the year.',\n"," 'We are on track to deliver another outstanding year with great momentum and that sets us up for a very bright future.',\n"," 'As always, thank you for your ongoing support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Thanks everyone.',\n"," 'Thanks, Marc and good morning, everyone. We delivered another excellent quarter in Q2. This included 13% core organic revenue growth, $630 million of COVID-19 testing revenue, $5.51 of adjusted earnings per share, and over $1 billion of free cash flow. Revenue in Q2 was $930 million higher than we had incorporated in our previous 2022 guidance, with $640 million driven by ongoing strength in the core business and $400 million from testing, partially offset by $110 million due to higher headwind from foreign exchange. Similar to last quarter, the strength in the core was broad-based across businesses and end markets. From a geographic lens, $200 million of the beat was from China. In our previous guidance, we had assumed a $200 million headwind from the lockdowns in China and we offset all of that, half from strong local core growth and half from local testing support, a great achievement by our China team.',\n"," 'Our PPI business system enabled us to generate very strong pull-through on the revenue beat and adjusted EPS for Q2 was $0.52 higher than included in our previous guidance.',\n"," 'So Q2 was a continuation of our excellent financial performance track record.',\n"," 'Let me now provide you with some more details. Beginning with our earnings results, as I mentioned, we delivered $5.51 of adjusted EPS in Q2 and GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.22.',\n"," 'On the top line, our Q2 reported revenue grew 18% year-over-year. The components of our Q2 reported revenue increase included 3% organic revenue growth, a 19% contribution from acquisitions, and a headwind of 4% from foreign exchange.',\n"," 'Turning to our organic revenue performance by geography, the organic growth rates by region are skewed by the COVID-19 testing revenue in the current and prior year. In Q2, North America grew in the high single-digits, Europe declined in the low double-digits, Asia-Pacific grew in the low double-digits, with China growing over 20% and rest of world declined low double-digits. With respect to our operational performance, adjusted operating income in the quarter decreased 3% and adjusted operating margin was 23.7%, 530 basis points lower than Q2 last year. Adjusted operating margin was slightly higher than we had anticipated in our prior guidance for Q2, reflecting how our growth strategy and PPI business system enabled us to continue to manage dynamic times. In the quarter, we achieved strong price realization to effectively address inflation while also driving strong productivity and positive volume leverage in the core business. This was more than offset by the expected impact of incorporating PPD into our financials, lower testing volumes and continued strategic investments, including investments in our colleagues.',\n"," 'Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 43.2%, 740 basis points lower than Q2 last year.',\n"," 'For the second quarter, the change in gross margin was due to the same drivers as those for our adjusted operating margin. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 16.1% of revenue, a decrease of 180 basis points versus Q2 2021. The R&D expense was approximately $360 million in Q2, representing growth of 6% over the prior year quarter.',\n"," 'You can see the benefits of our prior R&D investments in our differentiated core organic growth rate and the exciting new products that Marc outlined. Moreover, the continued investments we are making in R&D are helping to fuel an even brighter future.',\n"," 'Looking at our results below the line for the quarter, our net interest expense was $112 million, approximately flat to Q2 last year.',\n"," 'Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 13%. This was 100 basis points lower than Q2 last year, driven by our tax planning initiatives. Average diluted shares were $394 million in Q2, approximately $2 million lower year-over-year, driven by share repurchases net of option dilution.',\n"," 'Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, year-to-date cash flow from continuing operations was $3.7 billion and free cash flow was $2.6 billion.',\n"," 'Our capacity and capability investments continue to progress well and our year-to-date net capital expenditures were $1.1 billion. We returned over $115 million to shareholders through dividends in the quarter and this reflects the 15% dividend increase we announced in February. We paid down $1.85 billion of commercial paper in Q2 and ended the quarter with approximately $1.9 billion in cash and $30.3 billion of total debt.',\n"," 'Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.3x gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 2.2x on a net debt basis. Concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 16.6%, reflecting the strong returns on investment that we are generating across the company.',\n"," 'Now I will provide some color on the performance of our four business segments.',\n"," 'Let me start with a couple of framing comments. The scale and margin profile of our COVID-19 testing revenue varies by segment and the testing revenue was significantly higher in the prior year quarter that does skew some of the reported segment margins. And as I mentioned earlier, we are executing strong pricing realization across all segments to address higher inflation. And as we outlined at the beginning of the year, we are referring to our acquired PPD business as our clinical research business and that resides in laboratory products in Biopharma Services segment.',\n"," 'So, moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Science Solutions, Q2 reported revenue in this segment declined 7% and organic revenue was 5% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q2, we delivered very strong growth in our bioproduction business. This is offset by lower revenue in the genetic sciences business driven by the moderation in testing revenue versus the year ago quarter. Q2 adjusted operating income in Life Science Solutions decreased 23% and adjusted operating margin was 40.3%, down 800 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity, which is more than offset by unfavorable business mix and the strategic investments we are making across the segment. In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 9% in Q2, and the organic growth was 13%. The strong growth in this segment this quarter was led by electron microscopy and the chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses. Q2 adjusted operating income in this segment increased 23% and adjusted operating margin was 21.4%, up 250 basis points year-over-year.',\n"," 'During the quarter, we delivered strong volume flow-through and productivity that was partially offset by strategic investments.',\n"," 'Turning to Specialty Diagnostics, in Q2, reported revenue declined 11% and organic revenue was 8% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q2, we saw strong underlying growth in our immunodiagnostics and microbiology businesses, as well as our healthcare market channel. This is offset by lower COVD-19 testing revenue versus the year ago quarter.',\n"," 'While Q2 adjusted operating income decreased 1% in the quarter, adjusted operating margin was 22.1%, up 220 basis points from the prior year quarter. In Q2, the impact of lower testing volume was more than offset by strong productivity enabled by our PPI Business System and positive business mix. And finally, in Laboratory Products & Biopharma Services segment. Q2 reported revenue increased 55%. Organic growth was 10% and the impact of acquisitions was 48%.',\n"," 'During Q2, we had strong growth in the research and safety market channel and in the Pharma Services and Laboratory Products businesses. PPD, our clinical research business, is performing very well and continues to exceed our expectations.',\n"," 'During the quarter, it grew slightly higher than the rest of the segment, contributing $1.72 billion of revenue. Q2 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 55% and adjusted operating margin was 12.5%, which is 10 basis points higher than the prior year quarter. In the quarter, we drove strong productivity and also still the benefit from acquisitions. This was partially offset by strategic investments and unfavorable business mix.',\n"," 'Let me now turn to our updated 2022 guidance. And as Marc outlined, we’re raising our full year revenue guidance by $700 million to $43.15 billion.',\n"," 'We’re also raising our core organic revenue growth outlook from 9% to 11%. And on the bottom line, we’re raising our adjusted EPS guidance for 2022 by $0.28 to $22.93. The increase in revenue guidance is driven by three elements: a $750 million increase in the outlook for the core business; $500 million higher assumed COVID-19 testing revenue; and a $550 million decrease to reflect the recent changes in FX rates.',\n"," 'Let me provide you some color on each of these elements.',\n"," 'So starting with the $750 million increase in the outlook for the core business, this reflects a strong performance in Q2 and a $100 million increase in the core organic outlook for the second half of the year, and that second half raise reflects higher price we put in place to offset higher inflation versus the previous guidance.',\n"," 'As I mentioned previously, the increase in core revenue guidance raised the full year outlook for core organic revenue growth from 9% to 11%. This very strong growth performance reflecting excellent commercial execution and strong share gains.',\n"," 'In terms of our COVID-19 testing revenue assumptions, the $500 million increase for the year includes $400 million beat in Q2 and a $100 million increase in the assumption for Q3. This reflects an assumed glide path from Q2 to an endemic run rate level in Q4. There continue to be scenarios where testing demand could be higher than this level. And should that be the case, we’re well positioned to support customer needs. And as we did in the first half of the year, will flow the benefits of that through our P&L. But for now, we thought it was prudent to continue to take a de-risked approach to the outlook.',\n"," 'In terms of FX, we’ve incorporated current rates into guidance, and we now expect FX to be a year-over-year headwind on of $1.25 billion on revenue, up 3.2%. The FX headwind on adjusted EPS in 2022 has increased by $0.31 to $0.84 for the full year or 3.3%. The $0.31 change includes a 34% headwind in the second half of the year versus that previous guidance.',\n"," 'In terms of profitability, we expect to deliver $110 million more adjusted operating income, up the $700 million raise in revenue guidance. This reflects strong pull-through in the higher core and testing volume, additional price offsetting inflation and the impact of the headwind from FX. We now expect full year 2022 adjusted operating margin to be 25.2%.',\n"," 'In terms of adjusted EPS, our stronger outlook is enabling us to raise the 2022 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.28 from $22.65 to $22.93, further building on an already very strong outlook for the year.',\n"," 'So to recap on the guidance change, we continue to execute really well and are able to more than offset the significant FX headwinds, effectively manage inflation and still raise our full year outlook. This demonstrates the power of our proven strategy and our PPI business system execution.',\n"," 'Let me now provide you with a couple of other details on the 2022 guidance. PPD, our clinical research business is now expected to deliver $6.8 billion of revenue in 2022, which represents 12% core organic revenue growth on a full year basis for this business, up 1% from our previous guidance. We now expect the business to contribute just over $2 to adjusted EPS in the year, up $0.03 from our prior guidance.',\n"," 'Our guidance now assumes net interest expense of approximately $460 million for the year.',\n"," 'We’re assuming an adjusted income tax rate of 13.2% in 2022, slightly higher than the prior guidance.',\n"," 'We continue to assume net capital expenditures of approximately $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion and free cash flow of approximately $7 billion.',\n"," 'Our guidance still assumes $2.5 billion of capital deployment, which is a $2 billion of share buybacks to be completed in January and $475 million of capital returned to shareholders through dividends. And we continue to assume the full year average diluted share count will be between 394 million and 395 million shares. And finally, I wanted to touch on spacing of the P&L to help you with your modeling. When I think about the revenue dollars in Q3 and Q4, we expect Q4 to contribute just under 52% of the second half total. And looking at adjusted EPS on that same basis, we expect the second half total to be weighted a couple of percentage points more to Q4 than the revenue. To conclude, we delivered another excellent quarter and in a great position to achieve our 2022 goals. With that, I’ll turn the call back over to Raf.',\n"," 'So Patrick, in terms of the setup on pricing, then back to kind of a normal year for us, about 0.5% to 1 percentage point of net price across the whole business. And for the first half of the year, we’ve been running kind of slightly north of double the high end of that range. And the additional pricing we put in place is really to offset higher inflation that we’re seeing largely energy costs in Europe as we think about the change in guidance. And that change in guidance is really slightly higher revenue and no impact on adjusted operating income or adjusted EPS, but a little pressure on margin, which is the reason why the overall margin came down in the guidance from the last guidance. But that’s kind of active management of the pricing to offset the additional inflation.',\n"," 'I think looking at FX rates, if they stayed the same as they are now, that will be kind of an additional year-over-year headwind next year, about $600 million, about $0.40 of adjusted EPS. And I think about the mix of currencies and where currencies have changed. Obviously, that could change as we go through the year, but something to watch out for in corporate.',\n"," 'Yes, Dan, thanks for the question.',\n"," 'So, we have been very active on pricing from midway through last year.',\n"," 'So, it’s not just a this year thing. And we are being appropriately adjusting as we have seeing the impacts of inflation change. And as Marc mentioned before, it’s kind of how do you bring our customers with us at the same time.',\n"," 'So, we are pricing appropriately, given the economic challenges that are around and I think appropriately navigating.',\n"," 'So, I think about that, we are going to be dynamic as we go forward.',\n"," 'So, we will figure out what the markets look like, what the inflation looks like and adjust appropriately as we think about the second half of this year and then going into 2023.',\n"," 'So, it’s kind of a constant work in process is the way I view it. The teams have actually done a very good job so far, and we will continue to navigate that way.',\n"," 'So, on the gross margin, the gross margin came in exactly where I thought it would, so kind of in line with our expectations.',\n"," 'I think that on a year-over-year basis, I think a lot of people are missing the impact of PPD. It’s just under a 400 basis point impact on margin profile. And the rest really since the change both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year related to the mix in business in terms of testing versus other core and an element of pricing to offset inflation that also puts a little bit of pressure on margins so the other piece to it.',\n"," \"Welcome everyone to Cisco's third quarter fiscal 2022 quarterly earnings conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO; and Scott Herren, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the investor relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the financial information section of our investor relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be done on a year-over-year basis. Please note, included in the materials that accompany this call is a slide which summarizes the impacts from the war in Ukraine and the extra week in Q3 fiscal 2021. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2022. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties, including COVID-19, that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. I will now turn it over to Chuck.\",\n"," \"Thanks, Scott.

And I'll just wrap it up by saying Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call, which will reflect our fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal 2022 results will be on Wednesday, August 17, 2022, at 1:30 PM Pacific Time, 4:30 PM Eastern Time.\",\n"," \"So this concludes today's call. But if you have any further questions, feel free to reach out to the Investor Relations team. We thank you very much for joining us today.\",\n"," 'Thanks, Marilyn, and good afternoon, everyone. When we spoke with you back in February, we entered Q3 in the second half of our fiscal year with optimism despite the supply and component challenges and other headwinds impacting us and many of our peers. Many of those factors that fueled that optimism remain unchanged today.',\n"," 'We continue to see strong demand resulting in record backlog, our business transformation is progressing well and our differentiated innovation across our portfolio is helping our customers embrace and adopt the multiple technology transitions happening.',\n"," 'However, there were two unanticipated events since our last earnings call, which impacted our Q3 revenue performance.',\n"," 'The first is the war in Ukraine. This resulted in us ceasing operations in Russia and Belarus and had a corresponding revenue impact, which Scott will discuss.',\n"," 'The second relates to COVID related lockdowns in China, which began in late March. These lockdowns resulted in an even more severe shortage of certain critical components. This in turn prevented us from shipping products to customers at the levels we originally anticipated heading into Q3.',\n"," 'Our Q4 guidance incorporates a wider than usual range, taking into account the revenue impact of the war in Ukraine and the continuing uncertainty related to the China COVID lockdowns.',\n"," \"Given this uncertainty, we're being practical about the current environment and erring on the side of caution in terms of our outlook, taking it one quarter at a time. We believe that our revenue performance in the upcoming quarters is less dependent on demand and more dependent on the supply availability in this increasingly complex environment.\",\n"," \"While certain aspects of the current situation are largely out of our control, our teams have been working on several mitigation actions to help alleviate many of the component issues that we've been facing. We believe that we will begin to see the benefits of these actions in the first half of next fiscal year.\",\n"," 'Now let me talk more specifically about our third quarter performance.',\n"," \"As I just mentioned, many of the positives we've discussed over the past few quarters remain, resulting in continued solid demand for our solutions. Total product orders grew 8% year-over-year leading to yet another record backlog of well over $15 billion, up 10% sequentially and up 130% year-over-year. This momentum reaffirms the critical role we play in our customers' futures.\",\n"," 'Our business transformation also progressed nicely. In Q3, we saw ARR growth of 11%, ending the quarter at over $22 billion, and product ARR growth of 18%.',\n"," 'We also exited the quarter with over $30 billion in remaining performance obligations or RPO.',\n"," 'We also delivered non-GAAP EPS at the high end of our guidance range. This was driven by effective pricing actions and spending discipline, all of which allowed us to offset lower volumes and deliver both gross and operating margins above the high end of our guidance range and deliver on our bottom-line profitability target for the quarter. I want to reiterate what I said earlier. The fundamental drivers across our business are strong.',\n"," \"While we are facing some short-term challenges, it does not change our long-term outlook, our alignment to our customers' most critical challenges or our belief in the tremendous opportunities in front of us. Last week, we hosted our Global Customer Advisory Board meeting where we met with close to 100 customers. And they consistently shared that technology is at the heart of their strategy and has become even more important to everything they do. This driving not just their strategies, but also their overall business transformation. The technology they're adopting from Cisco is driving their business agility, allowing them to move with greater speed and empowering them to deliver differentiated experiences for their customers.\",\n"," \"Now I'd like to touch on some highlights from the quarter.\",\n"," 'We continue to see strong demand in several areas of our business.',\n"," \"Our web-scale business remains strong as we continue to help these customers build their capabilities to connect and serve their customers and end users at scale from the data center to the edge. This is leading to continued strength in orders, which grew over 50% and on a trailing four-quarter basis, we had over 100% growth. This marks our ninth consecutive quarter of solid demand as we are winning new franchises, expanding our design wins and taking share in web scale. I remain incredibly proud of the progress we've made in the momentum we have in this space.\",\n"," \"We are also extremely pleased with the traction of our 400 gig solutions, including the Cisco 8,000, which is the fastest growing SP routing platform in Cisco's history.\",\n"," 'In addition, our Silicon One portfolio, ZR and ZR plus optics and our Acacia portfolio of optical networking products also continue to perform well. From a product revenue perspective, our performance was led by solid demand across a majority of our portfolio, including switching, SP routing, wireless, security and SD WAN.',\n"," 'Our performance in these areas reflecting ongoing investments that our customers are making to rapidly digitize their organizations to deliver differentiated experiences.',\n"," \"Looking forward, the shift to hybrid cloud, 5G, 400 gig, IoT, hybrid work and the explosion of applications are driving the increased need for next generation networking, connectivity, security, and observability solutions. Cisco is well positioned to deliver for our customers with our end-to-end platforms and solutions. I'm also very proud of our pace of innovation.\",\n"," 'During the quarter, Cisco announced new innovations across our networking and cloud portfolios along with technologies to enhance experiences and hybrid work environments.',\n"," 'We also introduced our new predictive networks to help organizations learn, predict and avoid network disruptions.',\n"," \"We have even more innovation, which we'll announce at RSA and our own Cisco Live event in June.\",\n"," 'In addition to our deep passion for innovation, all of us at Cisco believe we have a unique opportunity to help make the world a better place through both the technology we build and the purpose we rally around to power an inclusive future for all. I believe this intersection of technology and purpose is why we were named the number one Best Company to Work For in the U.S. by Fortune and Great Place to Work for the second year in a row. In summary, while the quarter clearly did not play out as expected, demand remains solid and the fundamentals of our business are strong. We remain focused on executing against the strategy we laid out at our Investor Day.',\n"," \"We will also continue to be resolute in our focus to transform our business for more predictability and agility while bringing to market a robust pipeline of innovation. We remain confident in our long-term growth and the opportunities that we have in front of us. I want to thank our teams around the world for all that they do, executing with dedication, focus and excellence in an incredibly dynamic environment. They continue to focus on our customers with unparalleled innovation, resiliency and determination. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Scott.\",\n"," 'Yes, Meta. Thank you.',\n"," \"So on the demand issue, I'd point out a few things. Number one, without a 2-percentage point of orders that we de-booked relative to Russia and Belarus, we grew 10% against a year ago growth of 10%.\",\n"," 'So we feel good about that.',\n"," \"Our customers are not signaling any real shift at this point. We're not hearing that from them. Again, we had our global customer advisory board just a couple of weeks ago where we had 100 of our biggest customers and they were all talking about projects in the strategic nature of everything they're trying to accomplish. The last thing I would point out is on the enterprise side, last quarter we grew 37%.\",\n"," 'Just to keep in mind the way we define enterprise is a finite list of named customers.',\n"," 'So it tends to be more lumpy. If I look at how the industry defines enterprise, that would reflect a combination of our enterprise and our commercial business.',\n"," \"So for comparisons to what we're hearing in the marketplace, I thought we would give you that combined number.\",\n"," 'If you combine enterprise and commercial together, we grew 9%, but without the Russia impact, we actually grew 12% and on a trailing 12 months basis it grew 28%.',\n"," \"So we are still comfortable with the demand signals that we're seeing and our customers aren't telling us anything differently right now.\",\n"," \"Great, thanks. I'll pass it on.\",\n"," \"Yes. Samik, it's a great question.\",\n"," 'So let me start with just the basic answer is there is no reflection of demand issue in our Q4 guide, that has nothing to do with the Q4 guide.',\n"," 'Let me try to describe how we got to that.',\n"," \"I think it's important for everybody to understand. When we look at our Q3 results, we had -- from a revenue perspective, we had $200 million impact from us ceasing operations in Russia and corresponding revenue write-downs that occurred. Those were one-time. We then had, if you recall, our quarter ends at the end of April. Most of what you've heard from others, they are quarters into the end of March.\",\n"," \"So we experienced an entire quarter of the China lockdowns. In Shanghai, it was from March 27 until today. Shenzhen shut down, but again it opened up a week later, so we're talking really about the Shanghai situation.\",\n"," \"So we had $200 million from Russia and then we had $300 million that was completely attributed to our inability to get power supplies out of China. That's the simplicity of what caused the problem.\",\n"," \"As an example, we had 11,000 PCB assemblies built, we couldn't get power supplies for because of the lockdown. That's a simple fact of what happened in Q3. When we look at Q4 and you think about the Shanghai lockdown and what we've heard because in Shanghai, there are lots of components that go into our power supplies.\",\n"," \"So we're not able to get those components. Shanghai now is saying they're going to open up June 1. We don't know exactly what that means and what that means to win that implies that we would start getting any supply out. And correspondingly we believe when they open up and when they do allow transportation logistics to start up, we believe there is going to be a high degree of congestion. We believe that there is going to be lots of competition for ports capacity, airport capacity. And we just believe that that combined with the inbound efforts, trying to get raw materials back into the country, et cetera, we just believe that it's going to be impossible for us to catch up on this issue in Q4, which is what led to the guidance in Q4.\",\n"," \"So even though these top line numbers don't look good, it's very simple explanation as to what occurred.\",\n"," 'So then the follow-on part of your question is, when do we think this gets better. Well, if we make the assumption that China does begin to open up and we do begin to get more natural flow of the power supplies.',\n"," 'We also have had our teams over the last six to nine months have been working on a lot of mitigating actions, redesigning 100 products, over 100 products to give us component diversity, we believe that a combination of those starting in our Q1 and in the first half of our year will start to see the benefit of that.',\n"," \"So, that's when we expect to see it improve to some extent. We need to get through the next 90 days, but I'm just being as transparent as I can about what we see and when we think some of that improvement will occur.\",\n"," 'Yes, Ittai, thank you. Both good questions.',\n"," \"I think on the first one, I think that the biggest differentiation was April. I have spoken to peers who are feeling the same thing we are that we are reporting the full month of impact and it wasn't April issue for us.\",\n"," 'So now on a normalized basis for that question across the portfolio, all of us design products with different components in.',\n"," \"So there is opportunity for us to have a unique issue with one component that we may have designed into a product or we may have an unique advantage because we designed a certain component into a product. And those are the areas where I talked about we're redesigning where we have unique problems or just problems in general, though others may have the same problems.\",\n"," \"So we think that the exposure in general was because of the month of April. Also we do massive volumes. And in general, you would think that's a huge advantage, but just to put it in perspective, we shipped more revenue in the last week of our quarter than many of our competitors that you're referencing shipped in their entire quarter.\",\n"," \"So it's just an issue that it shows up in a bigger number for us than it would. If they have the same problem, it might be a $20 million impact for us, it might be a $200 million -- $400 million impact.\",\n"," \"So that's the first one.\",\n"," 'The second one what I would say is that we are constantly evaluating our global supply chain.',\n"," \"And so it's not about one country, it's about resilience. And the way we've designed supply chains over the last 15-20 years as an industry, I think we all realize we're evolving that now at the same time that we're triaging all of the current issues that we have.\",\n"," 'So our teams have a dual challenge. But we are constantly driving geographic resilience. The example I would give is that we -- before COVID we had regional redundancy built in, we did not have a plan for a country to shut down.',\n"," 'And so it takes time to go out and create that geographic resilience, but our teams are working on all of those kinds of things right now, so they will continue to do that any time.',\n"," 'Yes. It absolutely does, Simon.',\n"," \"Let me start and then I'll kick it to Scott to talk a little bit about it.\",\n"," 'So, first and foremost, we are incredibly active purchasers in the broker market. And you can imagine, with our buying power, they call us first.',\n"," 'And so -- no, that has nothing to do with it.',\n"," \"In fact, we've spent a lot of time with our supply chain team who had given us examples of where they've bought product in the broker market recently.\",\n"," \"So I don't think that's it. But Scott can explain what did happen there.\",\n"," \"First, I'll let Scott add on the price increase in a moment, but first of all, the price increase really did not have significant impact on our growth. We only passthrough pricing at the time that was offsetting our incremental cost. And to be honest, we've incurred more cost since then.\",\n"," \"So we were at a place right now where we have not even passed through all the costs that we have incurred. We're getting price increases all the time now.\",\n"," \"So that's the first answer.\",\n"," 'On the second one, the easiest thing for me to tell you is what I said earlier that the way our peers view and report and the industry views and reports enterprise would be the combination of our enterprise and commercial business which last quarter would have grown 9% and would have grown 12% without -- or it grew 9%, but would have been 12% without Russia.',\n"," \"So if you think about the size of that those two businesses combined growing 9%, I'm pretty comfortable that the demand is still there. And if you look at our commercial business, which usually is the leading indicator of a shift of demand momentum, they grew 19% in the quarter.\",\n"," \"So I'm not concerned.\",\n"," \"I got you Rod and you're actually thinking about the right way.\",\n"," \"You think about exactly the way I'm thinking about it.\",\n"," \"So first thing I'll say is that I think any seasonality right now is out the window with the current situation and with what we've seen with the order demand. We were doing 18-month planning with certain customers. And if they placed 18 months' worth of orders last quarter and now they're going to pause and we may be doing it with three fewer customers this quarter.\",\n"," \"So I mean it's just -- it's a very difficult thing to get your head around.\",\n"," \"So there's two things that I look at. Number one, what is our quarterly growth rate vis-a-vis a year ago to see because I think about momentum of demand from one quarter to the next sort of -- you have to look at that delta, right. Because if you grow 30% on 1% and then you grew 30% on 15%, then that would be declining demand momentum. That's the way I think about the math, right.\",\n"," \"So that's one thing we watch for. But the second thing is I think to your point I've been talking to the team about it, when we start comparing against these 30% quarters, I think we have to go back two years and get a real assessment because those numbers we know had pull ahead in. We don't know how much as we've talked about, but I think you're right.\",\n"," \"We have to sort of doing analysis from two years back to really feel like what do we really seeing right now and that's -- it's going to be a difficult thing for us to navigate because the historical way we've looked at these metrics just won't apply right now. And I think once we cycle through a year, another four quarters of the stuff, maybe we get to normalized -- a normalized view.\",\n"," \"As I've said, we're going to go through a phase where our order demand growth will be lagging our revenue growth and then hopefully we'll get to a point where those two will get back into more of a predictive model and we just got to get there.\",\n"," 'I think COVID changed everything about how our customers think about technology.',\n"," \"I think that pre-COVID a lot of customers when they went to slow spending, they would stop spending on technology. And I think COVID had them feel the impact of those decisions. And they're not -- they're going to be very prudent about stopping key projects that are giving them customer differentiation capabilities or modernization of their infrastructure or supporting hybrid work or making sure they're not falling behind their competitors. I mean, it's just a different day to day relative to what CEOs, the public sector leaders, how they think about technology and the importance of it. Even though they thought it, it was really important three years ago, their understanding of today is much different.\",\n"," \"And so I'm not saying they won't make those decisions. I just think there is a higher bar for them to make those decisions.\",\n"," 'You want to take it, Scott?',\n"," \"Hi, Paul. Thanks. Yes, we had -- in Q3, it was very simple for us to articulate it because we know exactly what we were expecting and everything else. We don't have the ability in Q4 to understand when they're really going to open up and how much we're going to get, et cetera, which caused us to create the range we did. And just -- we're just being realistic about what we believe we'll be able to get out the door, but to actually peg it to power supplies, in particular, is pretty difficult. But I mean most of the issues that we see right now, the concerning area right now is really getting that open -- getting China opened up again, getting the stuff shipping and we need to see that.\",\n"," 'So Scott, you want to add something?',\n"," \"Q3 was right in line with normal pattern. And I think Paul, the thing to remember is, yes, we're a little skewed because we had three quarters of 30%. If we went back a year and a half and I said we're going to grow 10% product orders on top of a 10% quarter from a year ago, we would have been quite happy with it. We're just worried about it because it's fallen 330s when there was a lot of planned purchase built into.\",\n"," \"So we will tell you. Obviously next quarter we'll have an update, but right now, it doesn't feel like there's any significant shift.\",\n"," \"Paul, that's fine. But we never have any commentary about future bookings expectations.\",\n"," 'On the RPO that we talked about, you got the number right, $16.2 billion of short-term RPO, which is up 9%.',\n"," \"And so short term by definition means that accretes into the revenue stream in the next 12 months. That growing by 9% is a pretty good leading indicator of at least what that piece of -- how that piece of our business looks as we go into Q4 and then we'll give you an update on how short-term RPO growth looks at the end of Q4 and you can get a sense of it in the end of fiscal '23.\",\n"," 'You want to take it, Scott?',\n"," 'Yes, I mean with the backlog.',\n"," 'So a couple of things.',\n"," \"I think what you may be trying to get out on the backlog question is the durability of that backlog. And there is -- this is something that obviously we've been tracking very closely. What I'd say on order cancellations is they continue to run at a rate that is actually below where it was pre-pandemic.\",\n"," \"So we're not seeing any cancellations there.\",\n"," 'We continue to see very strong pipeline and pipeline build, which is something else that I think you would expect to see weaken if there was softening demand.',\n"," \"As we look at kind of further out with what's sitting in the backlog, we've also put in place a policy change that says those orders are non-cancelable with all orders are non-cancelable within 45 days of the committed ship date. That just went into place in the beginning of February.\",\n"," \"So orders that we've received since then within 45 days of shipment are non-cancelable. And for our biggest customers, we've been working with them on a bespoke basis to put in place agreements where we will guarantee supply, but they guarantee that those orders will not be rescheduled or canceled.\",\n"," \"So feel good about the durability of the backlog we've got.\",\n"," 'So, Tim, on the first one -- thanks for the questions, by the way.',\n"," \"On the first one, I think that as we see if we see reductions in our input costs over time, then we will take into consideration whether we pass those through to the customers. The reality is as we've taken on so many input costs increases that we haven't passed onto customers that will look at it holistically at the time where that stuff begins to occur is what I would tell you. I'm glad you asked on the software growth because I think it's something that we want to explain.\",\n"," \"So it's a little difficult to understand completely and we have a really interesting quarter because the extra week a year ago in the Russia situation and the supply chain situation.\",\n"," \"So let me try to take you through what's going on in software.\",\n"," 'If you start with the fact that we have well over $2 billion of software in backlog that is connected to a piece of hardware that we will not begin recognizing the revenue until the hardware ships.',\n"," \"So -- and that's up $1 billion year-over-year.\",\n"," \"So there is a large component of software that we're not recognizing right now that we would in normal times.\",\n"," \"So it's the first piece. And then if you take into consideration the extra week from a year ago where we do ratable recognition of revenue on a daily basis, we had an extra week. And then you take the software that we wrote down -- software revenue that we wrote down as a result of ceasing operations in Russia.\",\n"," \"So those three -- the first one is hard to put a number on, but assume it's reasonable. The Russia and the extra quarter was a 5-point headwind to our software growth.\",\n"," \"So I know it's a little complicated, but I wanted to make sure you understood that.\",\n"," \"So I would expect this stuff to normalize back particularly without the Russia and the extra week impact. And then when supply chain starts to clear, then we'll start to see those normalized growth rates that we would expect, so hopefully that wasn't too complicated.\",\n"," \"Yes. The renewal stuff in '23, it could be helpful.\",\n"," \"We are continuing to make progress on that across the portfolio. I mean, we've got subscriptions running on switching on routing, enterprise routing, on enterprise wireless. We've even built some subscriptions into our mass scale infrastructure group. We've got subscriptions now in our data center networking group.\",\n"," \"So they'll sort layering in over the next few years.\",\n"," 'So first of all I think market share is incredibly difficult thing to assess right now because of the backlog situation, supply chain situations and we have a complex portfolio.',\n"," \"So are we losing share in somewhere? I suspect there is somewhere that we are losing share. But in our core markets, I actually feel really good about how we're performing and the demand that we've seen in whether it's WiFi or switching or particularly in SP routing and in the web scale space and other areas.\",\n"," \"So I don't think there is a widespread problem of share, but I'm sure there are pockets that we -- our teams are working on improving.\",\n"," \"So that's the first piece. Amit, on the China thing, let me -- what we've built into the guide is just a whole lot of uncertainty right now. Because we recognize that when they do open up, first of all, we don't know what that means. We don't know what open up means. Does it mean that they're going to slowly open grocery stores and salons and things of that nature and that the logistics side of it or do they open up the logistics all day one? What does it mean about the capacity of resources they have for the logistics side? But our concern is that every company there is going to be trying to ship out? In some cases, many of the factories have been approved to keep working and their workers have been working in dormitories.\",\n"," \"So they have components or ready to ship product that is sitting on the floor and it's all going to raise for the ports. It's all going to compete for the airports. And we know there's lower air traffic capacity right now for us to leverage.\",\n"," \"So we're concerned about how long it takes to clear that up, which is reflected in the guide.\",\n"," 'We also think that once it gets into their ports and it starts coming in the U.S., we have the risk of seeing what we saw in LA several months ago.',\n"," \"So those are all just the unknowns about what does opening up look like and what's the timeframe for recovery that led us to the cautious guide that we put out there. And I would just remind you that it's not just Shanghai.\",\n"," 'I think as of the last article I read, there were like 45 cities that were in lockdown and it was over a quarter of the population of China.',\n"," \"So it's broader. But that's how we're thinking about it and we just have to wait and see how it unwinds.\",\n"," \"So first of all, I want to thank everybody for spending time with us and diving into this the complex situation that we face. It's clearly a dynamic and challenging environment. We clearly faced unanticipated events during Q3 with the COVID lockdowns and the war in Ukraine. We think the short-term challenges that we will manage through, our teams have been working really hard on these mitigation actions that we believe will begin to benefit us in the first half of our next fiscal year, which is good. We're successfully realizing price increases, which is good. And also in Q3, even though we had a miss on the top line, I just want to point out that it was a record EPS quarter for us as a company. And at the low point of our guidance for Q4, we will deliver record EPS for the full year.\",\n"," \"So while the topline is disappointing, we have navigated this complex year and actually will deliver solid EPS when we're done. The fundamentals are strong a lot, still in our favor. Demand, business transformation is working, the technology transitions and the number that we're participating in.\",\n"," 'We have great teams around the world and that leads me to have a high degree of confidence despite the short-term challenges that we face.',\n"," 'So thank you all for spending time with us and we look forward to connecting with you next quarter.',\n"," 'Thanks, Chuck. We saw solid growth in product orders, net income and earnings per share despite the challenges Chuck just outlined.

In March, we stopped business operations in both Russia and Belarus, which had a negative impact to revenue of approximately $200 million or two percentage points of growth. Historically, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine collectively have represented approximately 1% of our total revenue. The impact this quarter was a bit higher than our historical run rate due to additional charges to revenue we recorded for uncollectible receivables and other items. And as a reminder, Q3 of last year included an extra week, which was a benefit of total revenue in Q3 of '21 of approximately three, four percentage points of growth.

Internet for the Future was up 6%, driven by strength in Acacia, optical, optics and core networking products including double-digit growth in the Cisco 8000. Collaboration was down 7%, driven by declines in our meetings, calling and contact center offerings, partially offset by the continued ramp of our communication platform-as-a-service. End-to-End Security grew 7% with broad strength across most of the portfolio.',\n"," 'Our Zero Trust portfolio performed well with double-digit growth driven by strong performance in our Duo offering.

I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A.\",\n"," \"Yes, it's a great question, Simon. What I'd add is, if you recall, we did two price increases this year.\",\n"," \"The first one enrolled in right about the end of the calendar year and the second one at the beginning of our second quarter. And we said at the time that we thought -- you continue to ask like what are those price increases, when they are going to show up in the top line? And we said we thought we would begin to see the benefit of those toward the end of the third quarter, which is the quarter we just closed and that's exactly what happened.\",\n"," \"So while the unit shipments in the quarter were off because of the issues that we've talked about with the supply chain with the component supply, the -- we were able to offset that with pretty strong pricing.\",\n"," \"In fact, the list -- we published this in our Q, so you'll see it there, but our pricing was up about 160 basis points in Q3.\",\n"," \"So while we do have a unit impact from the component supply, it was offset by some of the things that we're doing in the -- we are beginning to realize on the price front.\",\n"," \"We are actively pursuing every avenue. It's got to be a qualified vendor and so we're working to qualify different sources at the same time.\",\n"," \"We are actively pursuing that whether it's through a broker, obviously directly from the vendor, but through a broker, distributor, we're pursuing all those channels and that is creating a bit of a headwind to us.\",\n"," 'Yes. And Sami to the first part of your question, the 160 basis point impact that we saw in Q3 from pricing is a revenue statement. Obviously to go from bookings to revenue, it first has to flow through the backlog and then get realized.',\n"," \"So the impact on bookings while we haven't quantified, it would be a little bit higher than that 160 basis points.\",\n"," \"Yes, Tal, I think the way to think about it is back to one of the statistics that we gave you first time last quarter and then again this quarter. We've got backlog now greater than $15 billion in product. And within that, more than $2 billion of software sitting in backlog.\",\n"," \"You add that to the $30 billion plus of RPO we've got and we're sitting on about $45 billion of sales we've transacted that have not yet accreted to the revenue line.\",\n"," \"So I think it for as you think about the way you want to model out next year, you need to think about the rate and pace of revenue growth being dependent on supply versus being dependent on in quarter bookings growth. And that's certainly the way I think about it.\",\n"," \"Yes, I think some of that is available in the slides that we'll put up online. It may also be in the press release. We talked about enterprise. Enterprise orders were flat for the quarter, but then you have to normalize in the impact of the Russia and Belarus, the decision to stop operations in Russia and Belarus, that would take it up to 3% growth in orders. That's following a quarter where enterprise grew 37% and the quarter before that it grew 30%.\",\n"," \"So with these -- the way we define enterprise, as Chuck talked about, it's our biggest customers. And that business by definition is going to be a bit lumpy. But on a trailing 12 months, it's actually quite strong.\",\n"," \"We continue to see nice growth in SP, particularly in web scale. We gave you some of those stats during the call as well. Those are doing well. Public sector continues to hold up. Public sector demand has continued to be fine for us. And commercial, you remember we talked about this when we first went into the pandemic that we saw commercial tip down before the rest of the sales tip down. And then as things begin to recover in late fiscal '20, we saw commercial tip up. It tends to be a leading indicator for us. And commercial growth product, order growth was up 19% last quarter.\",\n"," \"So we're not seeing -- if that's the leading indicator and it certainly has been for us, we're not seeing any weakness in demand at this point.\",\n"," \"Yes, what I'd add to that is we give the example of power supplies because that was a constraint in Q3 and part of the issue that we had in Q3 is that constraint came up very late in the quarter, right. When Shanghai went into lockdown, we didn't immediately see that hit. It hit more towards the second half of April which, of course, was within our quarter. It wasn't within the quarter of many of our peers. And there was just no time to recover from that, but I don't want you to oversimplify and I hope I'm not leading into that. It's not just power supplies. We've got issues in a number of different areas. I tried to give you a sense of scale because I know it's 41,000 unique components what we said is about 350 have potential supply concerns right now. We're working those every day and every day some of them get resolved and then every day a couple more will come on to that list.\",\n"," \"So it's not -- unfortunately, it would be convenient if it was just one or two things and we could say here's exactly what those are. It is a very dynamic situation. And what we're trying to do if you zoom up a level and say, we're not assuming it gets better or worse as we scroll through Q4 and that's what's built into the guide.\",\n"," 'Zero. There is no demand impact our Q4 guide.',\n"," 'It was normal, very normal.',\n"," \"Yes, there is kind of two angles to that David that I'll try to touch on. One is the, when does the backlog itself peak and while we don't forecast that, it would not surprise me to see it grow again in Q4.\",\n"," \"On the second piece in terms of purchase commitments you saw they were up pretty substantially again in Q3, I guess, back to the earlier question of as our supply chain team not being aggressive enough in pursuing parts, purchase commitments now set at a pretty high level and inventory sits at a pretty high level. And that's so that as we clear the supply constraints on a few critical components, we can actually quickly convert that into finished goods product and get it in the hands of our customers who want those products.\",\n"," \"So is the peak now, is the peak in Q4, Q1, really a lot depends on the fluidity of availability of these critical components that we're chasing down?\",\n"," \"I hope that makes sense to you. We were sitting on both a record backlog and record inventory, which seems like it's in contrast with one another. But it's not, right. We're holding onto the parts that we've got and we just have to get the remainder to square the sets and get those built out the door.\",\n"," \"Yes. Ben on the first part of your question, I didn't exactly follow your math, but relative to expectations we talked about, yes, in the month of April, we talked about the -- obviously the decision we made to stop operations in Russia, Belarus, had a $200 million impact of the quarter. Most of that was -- it was two months of revenue that we had to forego and there were some receivables we had to write off within that.\",\n"," \"On the supply chain side, we would have made up the remainder of that delta to our expectations for the quarter. I hope that answers your question. I'm not quite sure I followed what you were trying to get at with that.\",\n"," \"Yes. I don't actually think about it in those terms.\",\n"," \"But yes, again if that didn't answer your question, Ben, we can follow-up afterwards.\",\n"," 'Good morning. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, will discuss second quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded.',\n"," \"Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our second quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement, and presentation deck are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Charlie.\",\n"," \"Thanks very much, John. Good morning. I'll make some brief comments about our second quarter results, the operating environment, and update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review second quarter results in more detail before we take your questions.\",\n"," 'Let me start with some second quarter highlights. We earned $3.1 billion in the second quarter, our results included a $576 million impairment of equity securities, predominantly in our venture capital business due to market conditions. Revenue declined as growth in net interest income driven by rising interest rates and higher loan balances was more than offset by lower non-interest income as market conditions negatively impacted our venture capital, mortgage banking, investment banking, and wealth management advisory businesses.',\n"," 'We continued to execute on our efficiency initiatives and our expenses declined from a year ago even with inflationary pressures and higher operating losses. We had broad-based loan growth with both our consumer and commercial portfolios growing from the first quarter and a year ago. Credit performance remained strong, our allowance reflected an increase due to loan growth.',\n"," \"While we're monitoring risks related to continued high inflation, increasing interest rates, and the slowing economy, which will impact our customers, consumers and businesses have been resilient so far. When looking at simple averages across our entire portfolio, consumer deposit balances per account increased from first quarter and a year ago and remained above pre-pandemic levels. Overall, our consumer deposit customers' health indicators, including cash flow, payroll, and overdraft trends are not showing elevated risk concerns.\",\n"," \"However, we're closely monitoring activity by segment for signs of potential stress and for certain cohorts of customers, we have seen average balances steadily decline to pre-pandemic levels.\",\n"," 'Following the final federal stimulus payments early last year and their debit card spend has also been declining. Overall, debit card spending was up 3% compared to a year ago when consumers receive stimulus payments and then sanction appears to be impacting certain categories of spending, including a 26% increase in fuel driven by higher prices, while discretionary categories like apparel and home improvement spending were down double digits, driven by fewer transactions. Credit card spend increased 28% from a year ago. Above the industry trend driven by the new products we launched last year, with double-digit increases across all spend categories.',\n"," 'However, spending while still strong, started to slow in May and June. Consumer credit card utilization rates remain below pre-pandemic levels. Payment rates remained strong and delinquency rates remain low.',\n"," 'Our small business portfolio continues to perform well in the aggregate in both delinquencies and losses. Leading indicators such as payment rates, deposit levels, utilization and revolving debt trends do not yet indicate signs of stress. Loan demand from our commercial customers remained strong with broad-based balance and commitment growth.',\n"," \"Our commercial customers' credit performance remained strong with exceptionally low net charge-offs and non-accrual loans were at their lowest level in over 10 years.\",\n"," 'However, we are monitoring early warning indicators across portfolios including cash flow activity, credit line utilization rates and industry fundamentals for inflation impacts.',\n"," \"Now let me update you on progress we've made on our strategic priorities.\",\n"," 'Our work to build an appropriate risk and control infrastructure is ongoing and remains our top priority, but we also continue to invest in our businesses to better serve our customers and to help drive growth. This week, we launched our fourth new credit card offering in the past year, Wells Fargo Autograph.',\n"," \"Our latest card reflects our momentum in growing our consumer credit card business with new accounts up over 60% from a year ago. We're focused on delivering competitive offerings and our new reward card provides three times points across top spending categories including restaurants, travel and gas stations. This is the first of several rewards based cards we plan to introduce.\",\n"," 'We continue to improve the digital experience in the second quarter with the relaunch of Intuitive Investor, our automated digital investing platform. We simplified the account opening process and created a faster and better experience for both new and experienced investors.',\n"," 'During the second quarter, we began rolling out Wells Fargo Premier, which provides differentiated products and experiences focused on strengthening and growing our affluent client relationships.',\n"," 'We are working towards offering one set of products and services that are tailored to the needs of these customers regardless of where they sit within our individual businesses.',\n"," 'We will be rolling out more enhancements in the coming quarters to provide a more compelling offering for Premier clients. We started to roll out overdraft policy changes late in the first quarter, which included the elimination of fees for non-sufficient funds and overdraft protection transactions.',\n"," 'Additional changes will be rolled out in the second half of this year, including providing customers who overdraw their account with a 25-hour grace period to cure a negative balance before incurring an overdraft fee, giving early access to eligible direct deposits and providing a new easy short-term credit product.',\n"," 'We expect these changes will help millions of consumer customers avoid overdraft fees and meet short-term cash needs, and we continue to review other ways we can help consumers manage their finances.',\n"," \"We also continue to invest to better serve our commercial customers. And early in the second quarter, Tim O'Hara joined the Corporate Investment Bank for BlackRock as Head of Banking. Tim's expertise and insights will help us maximize our potential and achieve even greater partnership and strategic dialogue with our corporate and institutional clients, and he complements the strong leadership team in our markets and commercial real estate businesses, who have helped us navigate recent market volatility. We believe we have a significant opportunity to serve our existing commercial customers with corporate and investment banking products in a way that works within our existing risk tolerance.\",\n"," 'We also believe that for us to be successful as a company, we must consider a broad set of stakeholders in our decisions and actions. Last week, we announced that Otis Rolley will be joining Wells Fargo from the Rockefeller Foundation as the Head of Social Impact, leading community engagement and enterprise philanthropy, including the Wells Fargo Foundation.',\n"," 'We continue to move forward in the area of ESG with the announcement of our 2030 reduction targets for greenhouse gas emissions attributable to financing activities in the oil and gas and power sectors.',\n"," 'As homeownership remains out of reach for too many families, we announced an effort to support new home construction, renovation and repair of more than 450 affordable homes across the US in collaboration with Habitat for Humanity and rebuilding together.',\n"," 'We also launched our special purpose credit program to help minority homeowners refinance mortgages that Wells Fargo currently services.',\n"," 'We continue to support our small business customers through this time of uncertainty, including launching the small business resource Navigator, which connects small business owners to potential financing options and technical assistance through community development financial institutions across the country.',\n"," \"We are also helping women entrepreneurs by doubling our support for women-owned businesses through the Connector program with complementary mentorship opportunities. We published our inaugural diversity, equity and inclusion report, which highlights the meaningful positive results we've made on our DE&I initiatives.\",\n"," 'For example, in the US, our external hiring of individuals from racially or ethnically diverse populations increased by 27% in 2021 compared to 2020, and approximately one-third of all internally promoted executives last year were racially or ethnically diverse.',\n"," \"As I've said in the past, advancing DE&I at Wells Fargo is a long-term commitment, not a project and we continue to pursue many of the initiatives in the report and look for ways to deepen our impact.\",\n"," \"Let me just make some summary comments before turning it over to Mike. The Federal Reserve's commitment to an aggressive rate hike cycle as a means to tame high persistent inflation continues to fuel market volatility and is expected to slow the economy, which will impact our consumer and commercial customers. Despite the economic environment, I remain optimistic about our future. Credit quality remains strong, and we expect net interest income growth to continue given rising interest rates which should more than offset any further near-term pressure on non-interest income. We remain on target to achieve a sustainable 10% ROTCE, subject to the same assumptions we've discussed in the past, on a run rate basis in the second half of this year, and then we will discuss our path to 15%. This year's Federal Reserve stress test confirmed our strong capital position and our ability to support our customers and communities while also continuing to return excess capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases.\",\n"," \"As we previously announced, we expect to increase our third quarter common stock dividend by 20% to $0.30 per share, subject to approval by the company's Board of Directors at its regularly scheduled meeting later this month. I will now turn the call over to Mike.\",\n"," 'Hey, Ken, this is Charlie.',\n"," \"Let me take that. The way we think about it is as we sit and look towards next year, we certainly know we have some increases to contend with, such as the full year impact of inflationary pressures that we see this year. And we know we've got some increases in FDIC insurance premiums. But as we start thinking about next year, and we really just starting the budget process, our mindset going into it is that we have significant opportunities to become more efficient. We've been – and it's just more of the same in terms of what we've been talking about. And this has nothing to do with getting efficiencies out of the risk-related work it assumes that all of that investment continues. But we do go into this process with the expectation that we want to see net expense reductions.\",\n"," \"Now, just usual caveats that excludes revenue-related expenses, which could go up or some of this – the lumpiness that we've talked about, just as we think – but as we think about that core expense base, we do continue to see opportunities, and we'd like you to see it as well.\",\n"," \"Yeah. Hey, John, it's Charlie. Why don't I start and then Mike can chime in. Yeah. I mean, I think your – no question, we – clarity of SCB for us at this point does really help.\",\n"," \"As we sit here today and we look at what's happening in spreads and what's happening with the 10 year that was at 292 right now. But we do want to be all but just conservative in terms of how we think about managing the capital base.\",\n"," \"So just to be – I think to be clear, as we sit here today, we're very happy with the amount of capital that we have, including, as we think about that 10 basis points increase that will impact us. We certainly have capacity to buy shares back at this point. And as I think Mike alluded to, we just probably want to wait a little bit just to see what happens in terms of the volatility in spreads and rates before we start to do that. But we certainly at a point, we'll do it. We'll just see exactly when that is.\",\n"," 'Yes. What we said a couple of times was that we thought it was possible that it was going to increase, and it did.',\n"," 'Now you have to keep in mind, like we only have so much visibility into the underlying drivers of what causes it to go up or down in any given year.',\n"," \"Now there's a lot of stuff that's public, but there's also a lot of a lot of the modeling techniques that are quite easy to understand.\",\n"," 'And so, I would say we were pleased with the result, and we spent -- as many do probably, we spend a lot of time on trying to understand the drivers of the risk of the balance sheet and do our best to have positioned ourselves for -- toward the outcomes.',\n"," 'And so, we were pleased that’s working out.',\n"," 'Hey, John. Good morning.',\n"," \"Well, as you think about the process we go through, which I think is similar to most in a lot of ways, is you're really looking at a number of scenarios that you need to be thoughtful about and include in your modeling. And we've now, for a number of quarters in a row, have had a significant weighting on the downside scenario already.\",\n"," \"And some of those scenarios are pretty severe, right? And so you've got waitings on what some might term wild recession, more severe recessions, so you could create a lot of labels for them. But it's a number of scenarios that have different severities of downside.\",\n"," \"And so, we feel at this point that we've captured what we can look at and see or anticipate at this point based on all the factors that we need to evaluate in our current reserves. And I'll just point out also, as you look at us in the position we're in, yes, we didn't take down all of the reserves that we put up during COVID.\",\n"," \"And so as you sort of look through each of the underlying asset classes, we feel what we have today is appropriate. It's hard to see in the near term increasing them to the level that we had back in the pandemic. But I think that's a hard thing to see at this point. But I think we'll have to make sure as things evolve throughout the next couple of quarters. we'll have to incorporate that. But again, we already have a pretty significant weighting on those downside scenarios already. And it's a very -- as you would imagine, a very robust conversation that we go through each quarter to evaluate how we feel about it. And at this point, we feel it's appropriate for what we can see over the life of those loans.\",\n"," \"Yes. Yes, Erika, I think that's a really hard thing to give a pinpoint number on at this point in the cycle, to be honest with you. And if you think about -- and it's -- there's so many moving pieces right now, I think, between -- particularly as you sort of get to year-end and the pace of rates? And what exactly is the Fed going to do and when are they going to do it? And so I think there's a lot that goes into that, that trying to get a -- one number is a hard thing to say with a lot of confidence in my view.\",\n"," \"I think what we can say though is as you look at the next couple of rate rises, I think you're going to start to see more acceleration.\",\n"," \"On the retail and the consumer side, the core -- deposit core rates haven't changed much for the big banks at this point yet.\",\n"," \"So you'll start to see that happen over the next couple of rate rises, the betas will still be pretty small.\",\n"," \"However, that will start to pick up just depending on how fast the Fed goes by year-end. And then I think on the other side of the spectrum on the corporate investment bank and those deposits, whether it's in the FI space or the large corporate space, you're seeing those betas pick up a lot already.\",\n"," 'So those will continue to accelerate.',\n"," \"And so when you look at cumulative betas, you really have to look at and you start to compare different banks, you're really going to have to look at the mix of the deposits. And the CIB deposits are just a much smaller piece of the pie for us right now. And those are going to -- those will probably move faster than even we've modeled, but it's a small piece of it.\",\n"," \"So I think we'll see how it goes, and we'll give you as much insight as we can. But I think trying to predict cumulative betas by year-end is hard.\",\n"," \"No problem. I'm glad you made it rhetorical.\",\n"," \"Let me take a shot at this first. Listen, I think we have the work we're doing on all of the risk and infrastructure work, which supports the regulatory matters. It's our own headcount. It's professional. It's a bunch of technology work. It really cuts across a whole series of lines. And I just don't really think it's the right time for us to start even talking about where those saves could come from. And it's just genuinely not on a radar screen in terms of what we're thinking about where it's going to go or anything like that.\",\n"," \"So I'd rather just defer the question at this point.\",\n"," \"Sure. Yes. And that was, by the way, not meant to be a new comment. That's something that we've been doing ever since I got here, and we brought a new management, including Kristy Fercho, who runs the business. And I mean, if you just go back and look at how big we were in the mortgage business, we were a hell of a lot bigger than we are today.\",\n"," \"And so we have been all along just reassessing what makes sense for us to do, how big we want to be both in the context of what our focus should be in terms of our primary focus should be on service -- serving our own customer base -- and then to the extent that we have efficiencies, would it makes sense for us to do other business. But I guess my point was we're not interested in being extraordinarily large in the mortgage business just for the sake of being in the mortgage business. We're in the home lending business because we think home lending is an important product for us to talk to our customers about. And that will ultimately dictate the appropriate size of it.\",\n"," \"And so I would just -- when you look at how much we're originating versus the size of our servicing business. The servicing business over time will become smaller. And I think that's a smart and good thing for us for many reasons. And as I said, we're just going to -- we're going to focus on products that make sense for us in the context of where we can make money over the cycles, given all of the complexities and all the requirements that banks have that not necessarily everyone else have and make sure we're getting the right returns for it.\",\n"," \"No, yes. No, I would -- I mean, listen, we're still -- I would still assume that a substantial amount of our mortgage production would be eligible for sale. And whether it's through the agencies or through public market, that's all options that we want to continue.\",\n"," \"And so we'll still be originating mortgages across the spectrum, some of which will keep on balance sheet when it makes sense and others of which we'll sell, and we will have an MSR. Again, if you just look at how much we originated historically versus what we're originating today, it will naturally just come down over time.\",\n"," \"So Mike Weinbach, who had come in to run our home lending businesses. Put a whole series of things in place, including if you look at the leadership across all of our card business, our home lending business, our personal lending business in our auto business, all those -- that's an entirely new management team, plus new heads of -- I can go through all the other functions as well. And Mike put that in place, and we talked about it and he wanted to do something different.\",\n"," \"And so we're lucky enough to have a gentleman named Kleber Santos, who joined us 1.5 years to two years ago. Background he was a Capital One prior to that and McKinsey prior to that, and Kelber and I have worked extremely closely together and just thrilled to have him in that role.\",\n"," \"And so I think I wouldn't expect to see significant changes in the things that we've spoken about. We're focused on continuing the product build-out on the credit card side, again, focusing on customers that are broader customers in the franchise. Building our customer service around that and building out our digital capabilities and all the other parts of the business, which is work that we have underway.\",\n"," \"So I don't anticipate any material changes from where we are just with continued trends and the things that we've been talking about.\",\n"," \"Let me start, Mike. And Mike and I are both very involved in these conversations with Barry and his team I think if you look at our wealth business, it's run entirely different today than it was several years ago. We had separate platforms historically here between our brokerage business. We had two different private banks that operated under two different brands. We had our bank channel. And then completely separately, we had a digital platform, and we had a platform or advisers that wanted to go independent. The digital platforms and the platform for independent advisers had very little investment in it. And those would run -- but all of those businesses, they were run as separate businesses with separate product platforms and separate technology.\",\n"," \"And so what we've done is we now have one set of products and service capabilities that all of those product lines have access to. And we've combined the entire field under one leader. And we're investing in our digital capabilities, and we're investing in the capabilities of those that want to go independent.\",\n"," 'So if they want to do that, they can stay here as opposed to elsewhere.',\n"," \"We are building out capabilities across all the dimensions from the investment capabilities to the banking capabilities, our lending capabilities, offering trust in the other areas of distribution that didn't have access to those in the past.\",\n"," \"And so it's a huge set of changes, which also bring with it a set of changes in the back end, which we're going to move -- we're moving towards common platforms. And it's something we're really excited about, and we're just at the beginning of seeing the benefits of it. And I think it's one of the things that will make us appear to -- for our financial advisers, it’s been extremely attractive place to be, whether they want to be an employee and work for Wells Fargo or they want to be independent and access our capabilities.\",\n"," \"Yes. I would say -- yes, just not expand even further, Betsy. It's really a combination of the advisers and the products that Berry has to offer in our wealth management business. It is also leveraging the lending products that Clover is now responsible for, including credit card and including mortgage and potentially, auto and some other things there. In integrated offering with Mary's bank customers who are affluent.\",\n"," \"So it's an offering across all of our product sets directed in a much more segmented way than we've ever done in the past.\",\n"," \"And so we're extremely excited about it, and we'll be talking more about things that were capabilities that were going to be rolling out throughout the year.\",\n"," 'Yes. This is Charlie, Matt.',\n"," \"First of all, our targeted customer, those that we want to have a broader relationship with. What we have said is that as we've rolled out this new product set, when you look at the credit quality of the borrowers and the spenders that we have been giving our new cards due to the credit quality is actually stronger than it had been historically. And it still is either on target or stronger than we would have modeled for when we rolled the products out. It's just we're not competing on credit terms. We're not competing in any way, shape or form in terms of that. We just want to have a quality offering, we would expect it to be a high-quality card customer that we can do other things with across our franchise.\",\n"," 'Yes, I think you can get some of that in the Q, Matt, you got to go a little deep into the queue, but you can get some of that in the distribution table in the Q.',\n"," 'All right, everyone. Thank you very much. We appreciate everything and we look forward to talking to you all. Take care.',\n"," 'Thanks, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Net income for the quarter was $3.1 billion or $0.74 per common share, which included strong growth in net interest income as we are beginning to see the positive impact of higher interest rates.',\n"," 'Our results included a $576 million impairment of equity securities, predominantly in our venture capital business due to the market conditions, which drove a total loss from equity securities of $615 million in the second quarter. Recall that a year ago, when the markets were strong, our results included $2.7 billion of gains on equity securities.',\n"," 'While credit quality remains strong, our results included a $235 million increase in the allowance for credit losses due to loan growth, this follows six consecutive quarterly decreases in the allowance, including $1.1 billion in the first quarter and $1.6 billion a year ago. We highlight capital on Slide 3.',\n"," 'Our CET1 ratio was 10.3%, down approximately 20 basis points from the first quarter as declines in AOCI and dividend payments were largely offset by our second quarter earnings.',\n"," 'Our CET1 ratio also reflected actions we took to proactively manage our level of capital and risk-weighted assets as well as reduce our AOCI sensitivity by moving more securities the held to maturity and hedging securities in our available-for-sale portfolio.',\n"," 'Additionally, we did not buy back any shares in the second quarter. But as Charlie highlighted, the recent stress test results confirmed our capacity to return excess capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases.',\n"," 'We will continue to be prudent and consider current market conditions, including interest rate volatility, potential loan and risk-weighted asset growth as well as any potential economic uncertainty with respect to the amount and timing of share repurchases over the coming quarters.',\n"," 'Our 10.3% CET1 ratio remained well above our required regulatory minimum plus buffers.',\n"," 'As a reminder, based on the recent federal stress test, our stressed capital buffer for October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023 is expected to be 3.2%, which would increase our regulatory minimum plus buffers by 10 basis points to 9.2%.',\n"," 'Turning to credit quality on Slide 5.',\n"," 'Our charge-off ratio remained near historical lows and was only 15 basis points in the second quarter.',\n"," 'As we previously discussed, losses are not expected to remain at these low levels and we are closely monitoring our commercial and consumer customers for signs of stress, and we remain very disciplined in our underwriting. Commercial credit performance remained strong across our commercial businesses with only 2 basis points of net charge-offs in the second quarter, which included net recoveries in our commercial real estate portfolio.',\n"," 'We also had net recoveries in our consumer real estate portfolios and total consumer net charge-offs declined slightly from the first quarter to 33 basis points of average loans as lower losses in auto and other consumer loans were partially offset by higher credit card losses. Non-performing assets decreased $878 million or 13% from the first quarter. Lower levels of consumer non-accruals were driven by a decline in residential mortgage non-accrual loans due to sustained payment performance of borrowers after exiting COVID-related accommodation programs. Commercial non-accruals continued to decline, and as Charlie highlighted, we are at their lowest levels in over 10 years.',\n"," \"Our allowance for credit losses at the end of the second quarter reflected a continued strong credit performance, with an increase that was due to loan growth. On slide 6, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans grew 8% from a year ago and 3% for the first quarter. Period end loans grew for the fourth consecutive quarter and were up 11% from a year ago, with increases in both our commercial and consumer portfolios. I'll highlight the specific growth ogres when discussing operating segment results. Average loan yields increased 19 basis points from a year ago and 27 basis points from the first quarter, reflecting the benefit of higher rates. Average deposits increased $10 billion or 1% from a year ago, with growth in consumer banking and lending, offsetting declines across our other operating segments. The decline in average deposits from the first quarter reflected seasonality of tax payments as well as outflows from commercial and wealth clients.\",\n"," 'Our average deposit cost increased one basis point from the first quarter, driven by corporate and investment banking.',\n"," 'As I previously highlighted, we would expect deposit betas to accelerate as rates continue to rise and customer migration from lower yielding to higher yielding deposit products would likely increase as well.',\n"," 'Turning to net interest income on slide 7.',\n"," 'Second quarter net interest income increased $1.4 billion or 16% from a year ago and $977 million or 11% from the first quarter. The growth from the first quarter was primarily driven by the impact of higher rates, which increased earning asset yields and reduced premium amortization from mortgage backed securities, we also benefit from higher loan balances and one additional day in the quarter. We started the year expecting full year net interest income to grow by approximately 8% compared with 2021. Last quarter, we raised our guidance to an increase in the mid-teens.',\n"," 'With the market now expecting not only more rate hikes but also larger ones, we currently expect net interest income in 2022 to increase approximately 20% from 2021. And as a reminder, net interest income will ultimately be driven by a variety of factors, including the magnitude and timing of Fed rate increases, deposit betas and loan growth. On slide 8 and noninterest income.',\n"," 'This quarter, noninterest income -- this quarter, we included highlighting noninterest income to show that the decline from both the first quarter and a year ago was primarily driven by two cyclical businesses. Mortgage banking, which has slowed in response to higher interest rates and our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses, which a year ago generated elevated gains but recognized impairments in the second quarter of this year due to significantly different market conditions.',\n"," \"While all other noninterest income included both positive and negative impacts, it was actually up slightly from the first quarter. The decline in all other noninterest income from a year ago was primarily driven by the impact of last year's divestitures.\",\n"," 'Turning to expenses on slide 9. Noninterest expense declined 3% from a year ago as expenses related to divestitures came out of the run rate, and we continue to make progress on our efficiency initiatives. Operating losses increased $273 million from a year ago, primarily driven by increased litigation expense, which included a recovery in the second quarter of last year, and higher customer remediation expense predominantly for a variety of historical matters. Customer remediation matters are complex and take a significant amount of time to resolve and quantify the full impact.',\n"," \"While we've made progress, we have more to do to resolve the remaining items. We're halfway through the year. And while we've had higher operating losses than we expected, revenue related expenses are trending lower than expected.\",\n"," \"Our results in the first half of the year also reflected the progress we're making on our efficiency initiatives with lower headcount and reductions in both professional and outside services expense and occupancy expense.\",\n"," 'We expect to continue to make progress on our efficiency initiatives. Putting all these factors together, we still expect our full year 2022 expenses to be approximately $51.5 billion, as lower revenue-related expense is expected to offset higher operating losses. But as a reminder, we have outstanding litigation, regulatory matters and customer remediations and the related expenses could be significant and hard to predict, which could cause us to exceed our $51.5 billion outlook.',\n"," 'Turning to our operating segments, starting with Consumer Banking and lending on slide 10. Consumer and Small Business Banking revenue increased 17% from a year ago, driven by the impact of higher interest rates and higher deposit balances.',\n"," 'Our deposit pricing has been stable, but we expect deposit betas to increase over time.',\n"," 'As Charlie highlighted, the deposit-related fees were impacted by the overdraft policy changes we started to roll out late in the first quarter, which included the elimination of fees for nonsufficient funds and overdraft protection transactions.',\n"," \"Additional changes will be rolled out in the second half of this year, which will further reduce deposit-related fees. Home lending revenue declined 53% from a year ago and 35% from the first quarter driven by lower mortgage originations and compressed margins, given the higher rate environment and continued competitive pricing in response to excess capacity in the industry. After increasing over 150 basis points in the first quarter, mortgage rates increased over 100 basis points in the second quarter. The impact of higher rates also reduced revenue from the resecuritization of loans purchased from securitization pools. The mortgage market is expected to remain challenging in the near term, and it's possible that we have a further decline in mortgage banking revenue in the third quarter.\",\n"," 'We are making adjustments to reduce expenses in response to lower origination volumes, and we expect these adjustments will continue over the next couple of quarters.

Refinances as a percentage of total originations declined to 28%.

Credit card point-of-sale purchase volume was up 28% from a year ago with the largest increases in fuel travel and entertainment. The increase in point-of-sale volume and the launch of new products helped drive a 19% in credit card -- 19% increase in credit card balances from a year ago, we remain disciplined in our underwriting and new credit card accounts.',\n"," 'Turning to Commercial Banking results on slide 12. Middle Market banking revenue increased 27% from a year ago, driven by higher net interest income from the impact of higher rates and loan balances.',\n"," 'Asset-based lending and leasing revenue increased 8% from a year ago, driven by higher loan balances. Noninterest expense increased 2% from a year ago, primarily driven by higher operating costs. Efficiency initiatives drove lower personnel expense with headcount down 9% from a year ago. Average loan balances have grown for four consecutive quarters and were up 13% from a year ago. Utilization rates continue to increase, but they are still not back to historical levels. Clients have increased borrowings to rebuild inventory and to support working capital growth, both of which have been impacted by higher inflation.',\n"," 'We also had momentum from adding new clients in middle market banking and similar to prior periods, loan growth was driven by the larger clients. Average deposits declined 2% from a year ago driven by actions to manage under the asset cap. Deposit pricing has been relatively stable, but we expect deposit betas will continue to increase.',\n"," \"Turning to Corporate and Investment Banking on slide 13. Banking revenue increased 4% from a year ago, primarily driven by stronger treasury management results given the impact of higher interest rates as well as higher loan balances. Investment banking fees declined, reflecting lower market activity and $107 million write-down on unfunded leveraged finance commitments due to the market spread widening. Average loan balances were up 20% from a year ago, with broad-based loan demand driven by a modest increase in utilization rates due to increased working capital needs given inflationary pressures. Commercial real estate revenues grew 5% from a year ago, driven by loan growth and higher interest rates. Average loan balances were up 22% from a year ago with the disruption in the capital markets, increasing demand for bank financing and line utilization. Markets revenue increased 11% from a year ago, primarily due to higher foreign exchange and commodities trading revenue as clients position themselves for rising rates, quantitative tightening and growing recessionary concerns as well as higher equities trading. Average deposits in Corporate and Investment Banking were down 14% from a year ago, driven by continued actions to manage under the asset cap. There's been more deposit pricing pressure in corporate banking than we've seen in Commercial Banking. On slide 14, Wealth and Investment Management revenue grew 5% from a year ago as the increase in net interest income due to the impact of higher rates and higher loan balances more than offset the declines in asset-based fees, driven by lower market valuations as well as lower retail brokerage transaction activity.\",\n"," 'As a reminder, the majority of WIM advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter, so second quarter results reflected market valuations as of April 1st, and third quarter results will reflect the lower market valuations as of July 1st. The S&P 500 and fixed income indices declined again in the second quarter and approximately two-thirds of our advisory assets are in equities.',\n"," 'So, there will be another step down in our asset-based fees next quarter. Average loans increased 5% from a year ago, driven by continued momentum in securities-based lending. Average deposits declined 1% from a year ago and were down 7% from the first quarter as clients reallocate cash into higher yielding alternatives. Deposit pricing increased modestly. Slide 15 highlights our corporate results. Both revenues and expenses declined from a year ago and were impacted by the divestitures of our Corporate Trust Services business and Wells Fargo Asset Management and the sale of our student loan portfolio. These businesses contributed $580 million of revenue in the second quarter of 2021, including the gain on the sale of our student loan portfolio, and they accounted for approximately $375 million of the decline in expenses in the second quarter compared with a year ago, including the goodwill write-down associated with the sale of our student loan portfolio. The decline in revenue in corporate was also due to lower equity gains in our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses. In summary, while our net income in the second quarter declined driven by lower venture capital and mortgage banking results, our underlying trends reflected our improving earnings capacity with expenses declining and strong net interest income growth from rising rates and higher loan balances.',\n"," 'As we look ahead to the second half of the year, we expect the growth in net interest income to more than offset any further pressure on non-interest income.',\n"," 'While we expect credit losses to increase from historically low levels, our consumer and commercial customers are not showing any meaningful signs of stress.',\n"," 'As I highlighted earlier, our expense outlook for the year is unchanged at approximately $51.5 billion subject to the risk to the outlook discussed earlier.',\n"," 'Finally, our stress test results demonstrated our capacity to return excess capital to shareholders, including the expected 20% increase in our third quarter common stock dividend subject to board approval.',\n"," 'We will now take your questions.',\n"," 'Yes. Hey, thanks, Ken.',\n"," \"First, I'd start with the efficiency program that we've been talking about now for the better part of 1.5 years. And all of that's tracking as we thought it would.\",\n"," \"So the core, driving kind of efficiency through the core business lines and operating groups is sort of working the way we thought. When you look at what's happened this year, as you pointed out, operating losses are higher than what we assumed at the beginning of the year. And those things just can be unpredictable at times just as we work through the backlog of items.\",\n"," \"You know the accounting standard we work with, right? If we knew about something now, we would accrue for it. If we could estimate it, we would accrue for it. But we're just flagging -- continuing the flag that we still have a pipeline of stuff to work through. And then as you highlighted, as we think about this year, the increases in the operating loss line have been offset by -- largely offset by the lower revenue-related expenses.\",\n"," \"And so we still feel good about that $51.5 billion number that we set out at the beginning of the year. And we're going to continue to work through the pipeline of items. And if something is significant in tops, we will be sure to highlight it as we go forward.\",\n"," \"Yeah. Maybe I'll just add one or two things, John.\",\n"," 'I think as Charlie highlighted, we feel good about where we are. I would just point out, we are not – our G-SIB score is going to stay the same as we go into next year as well.',\n"," \"So we don't have another uptick as we go into the beginning of next year.\",\n"," \"So that's good. And at this point, we don't feel like we need to build capital from where we are to build a bigger buffer and then we'll just be prudent on buybacks as we go through, and through the next few quarters.\",\n"," 'I think, ultimately, the exact progression over the next couple of quarters will be a function of how the Fed moves on rates. But I would think of it as somewhat of a ratable step up quarter-to-quarter.',\n"," \"So not -- you won't see some outsized results in one versus the other as we go. And you'll continue to see a little bit of loan growth come through. We think that probably moderates a little bit from what we saw in the first half of the year, but you'll see some loan growth there as well as it steps up. And as you say, I think the industry has seen deposits come down a little bit.\",\n"," 'If you look at the latest version of the Fed data, and you can see that in our results as well.',\n"," \"Now for us, it's been a little bit of -- you can see the period end balances in each of the segments, and it's been a little bit of reduction in each of them with the lowest percent reduction being in the consumer space.\",\n"," \"So that's a good thing. And as you know, we -- over the last couple of years, we've brought down much of our wholesale funding that we've got out there.\",\n"," \"And so we've got plenty of capacity to provide liquidity or get the liquidity we need to continue to support clients.\",\n"," \"Well, Steve, I know you're really good at modeling this stuff.\",\n"," \"So I'll let you do the modeling. But I think as you pointed out, we're going to see step ups, right, as we go through the next -- as we did this quarter from last quarter. And that will continue into the third and fourth quarter. And now exactly what -- it's hard to use one quarter, as you know, it's just run rate for the rest of the -- for the following year. But certainly, the exit rate is going to be a lot higher than even where we are today. And then we'll have to just see what the environment is like at that point how to think about whether that's a clean run rate to build off of, or are there other things they're getting away. And as you can see, over the last -- even over the last three, four, five, six weeks, whatever it's been, the amount of volatility that's out there on the long end and what happens with loan growth, does it keep at the same pace.\",\n"," \"And so there's a lot of factors, I think, that go into what 2023 would look. But as you pointed out, our exit rate will be pretty healthy.\",\n"," \"Yes. I mean I think that's -- we're not expecting balances to grow much from where they are. And I think we'll see what happens as -- if we see continued outflows of deposits, but as you put it out, like our mix of deposits as we came in this environment sets us up pretty well, and you can see that in the results so far where the consumer deposits are a much bigger percentage of the overall pod than they were just a couple of years ago.\",\n"," \"As you think about beta, so far, they've basically progressed as we thought in each of the segments.\",\n"," \"And so we really haven't seen much variation to what we thought at this point in the rate cycle.\",\n"," \"Now if the Fed does raise rates 75 basis points at the next meeting, now you're starting to get into territory that we didn't see in the last rate cycle -- rate rising cycle.\",\n"," \"And so we're going to start to see betas increase from there. And I think that's exactly at what pace and where you need to be defensive or not on the wholesale side of the -- on the commercial side, we'll see, and we're pretty nimble and are able to react to it. But so far, everything has progressed as we thought it would.\",\n"," \"And so we're going to keep a pretty close eye on it as we go over the next few months. And I think that will -- this quarter and into the fourth quarter, I think, will give us a lot of interesting data points to know how to think about it over a longer period of time.\",\n"," \"Yeah, sure. Thanks, Scott. I'll just bring you through some of the key fee lines just to give you a sense of some of the dynamics, right? So on the deposit side, it's been pretty -- we saw a step down in the quarter, largely a result of the changes we made in overdraft fees. We'll see a little bit more step down as we go through the year, probably more a fourth quarter thing than a third quarter thing, as we implement the additional changes there, but there's -- other than that, there's a lot of stability generally to that line based on underlying activity. We'll see what happens in the market and how that drives the investment advisory and asset based fee line. That's -- it's going to be key to see what happens in the equity and the fixed income markets. And as we bring more stability enters into the market that really supports that fee line. And as you know that’s our single biggest line item as you look at that fees. Investment banking. It's really going to be market driven, but we -- our fees were pretty low, including the small mark that we had on -- in leveraged finance.\",\n"," \"And so it's hard to see that going too much lower, but that's really going to be driven by the activity levels. Card spend, we're seeing still good, although it slowed maybe a little in May and June. We're still seeing really good activity in the card space and people are outspending.\",\n"," \"So that's helpful. Mortgage banking, as you highlighted, I think, is likely going to come down a little more in the third quarter, but it's off a much smaller base.\",\n"," \"You can still have pretty big -- you can have decent sized percentage declines there, but it's still -- it's really small dollars at this point. And then we'll see as the market progresses and how that impacts the equity security side. But -- so I think hopefully, we're getting more stability here, but some of it will be dependent upon what we see in the markets.\",\n"," 'I think you can certainly see a little bit more decline from here potentially.',\n"," 'I think that’s not an unreasonable expectation. Exactly timing and how that’s going to progress, I think, is hard to predict with any real degree of accuracy, just given the environment we’re in right now. But I think it’s possible, they can be out a little bit more here.',\n"," \"Yes, we don't -- you got to think of these as unfunded commitments, not funded, right? So, as you sort of think about them, don't think about them outstanding, thinking about them as unfunded commitments, number one. And you really have to, over time, think about term loans versus high yield a little bit differently. And on the high-yield side, we don't disclose this, but we haven't disclosed the actual number, but it's really small in the scheme of the balance sheet and the term loan side, which generally has a little bit more stability to it and less volatility to it is the bigger part. All these deals are subject to further spread widening, given the environment we're in, for sure. We -- at the end of the quarter, took our best -- used our best judgment to market where we thought the deals would clear. And we'll see how that over the coming months.\",\n"," \"Well, I think we've -- as you think about each asset, each type of deposit, to-date, they're tracking pretty close to what we saw last cycle. But you then look at the mix of our deposit base, and that's what's changed pretty substantially since the last go around.\",\n"," \"And so if beta stayed the same as last cycle byproduct, given our mix has changed, you would see a lower average deposit beta. But there's a lot to play out as we go through the rest of the year, but in each of the underlying products.\",\n"," 'Yes. Sure. Look, and again, it really all depends on what happens in the public equity markets, which is in part driving those declines.',\n"," \"So if we see some stabilization, that's constructive. If we see much deeper declines, that's we'll have to evaluate how that impacts these portfolio investments. And obviously, if the market starts to rally, that's even more constructive.\",\n"," \"So I think the public equity markets and will be a good guide to how to think about whether or not we have to evaluate whether there's more reductions here or not.\",\n"," 'Yeah. I mean, on the training side, it was really good performance in our macro fixed income businesses, commodities, FX, a little bit of rates.',\n"," \"And so I think that's all what contributed to it. And we'll see, obviously, the continued performance, there is subject to what we see happening in the markets. It's not – we're not out there taking any kind of incremental risk that we normally take. It's really helping clients facilitate the flow that they've got there, and so we'll see how that goes. And as you can see, it's a relatively smaller number for us versus maybe some others.\",\n"," \"As you think about the securities portfolio, I wouldn't assume, there'll be continued gains there.\",\n"," 'I think we did do a small, small remixing of our securities portfolio.',\n"," 'Some of it was RWA optimization I think selling some UMBS is buying Ginnies that where spreads were pretty tight at the time we did it.',\n"," \"You save an RWA you don't give up much yield. And there are a few other minor optimizations we did there.\",\n"," \"Yeah. It's not a technology move.\",\n"," \"I think he's talking about platforms in terms of the overall sort of the way we operate business.\",\n"," \"So there isn't -- it isn't dependent upon a big technology conversion, Betsy.\",\n"," \"So -- and then I would just highlight one last thing. Charlie in his prepared remarks, talked about Wells Fargo Premier. That's step one in really helping provide more differentiated and holistic service offering to our affluent clients in the consumer business and the Wealth piece is going to be big part of that. And we already have 1,500 plus advisers in the branch system to do. We already have a great investment platform.\",\n"," \"And so we're in the early days, but building out a differentiated service offering there as well, which will be a big part of the wealth businesses going forward.\",\n"," \"Hey, Vivek, it's Mike. I'll -- maybe I'll take a shot at that. Look, we've just seen -- I just don't think what we've seen in the second quarter will continue to happen at the same pace. We may get surprised and it will be a little better than we think. But I think at some point, we just feel, as you look at any of the uncertainty that might be there or other factors that are causing clients that use their lines today that just may moderate as we go through it. I wouldn't look at it as some big warning of anything to come. It's just we're being a little -- we're being a little prudent in terms of the way we think about that growth rate and maybe we'll be surprised on the upside a little, but it's just what we're seeing right now.\",\n"," \"Not that I would say are super significant at this point. But when you go category-by-category and say, okay, well, spending in the card space continue to increase at the same pace given some of the uncertainty in the economic environment, we'll see maybe commercial real estate, certainly, given what we're seeing in the real estate market there, that appears like it will slow down a little bit again in the second half of the year.\",\n"," \"Somewhat driven by what we're seeing in the capital markets side of that business as well.\",\n"," \"And so with the slowdown in deals happening and rates rising, that's just as a natural slowdown there.\",\n"," \"And so I just think you go asset class by asset class, it just feels as though we'll see a little bit of moderation as we go through the rest of the year.\",\n"," 'The loan -- the leveraged finance one, Vivek?',\n"," \"I don't have the exact number in front of me. It's not materially different.\",\n"," 'Thanks, Latif. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit’s third quarter fiscal 2022 conference call.

I’m proud of the team and how we’ve delivered for our customers so far this year. And with that, let’s now – go now to your questions.',\n"," 'Yes, sure. Thank you for the question. I’ll break down your question sort of in three parts, given that we are a platform company with sort of a great profile of businesses. I’ll start with tax. I know that was not part of your question, but it’s important to start there, which is tax is sort of very resilient in any type of an environment, and it’s more than 30% of the company’s revenue when you look at both TurboTax and our ProTax business. In small business, there is a flight to digitization to manage your cash flow. And just I would remind us that we are now fundamentally a growth and money center platform for small businesses.',\n"," 'And so there is a flight to be able to manage your cash flow on our platform. And the two stats that I would use that are very recent and sort of the here and now, one, our loan business had a record high volume in April. It was 3x higher than it’s been year-over-year. And our charge volume continues to be strong.',\n"," 'As of last month and even in this last week, our charge volume has been growing north of 30%. And I use those a couple of stats just more as proof points in terms of the importance of our platform in these unique times. And when it comes to Credit Karma, first of all, on the demand side, I would say that when you get into tougher recessionary times, the demand for the products on our Credit Karma platform actually grows.',\n"," 'Now it’s – the discussion is about the supply side. And in fact, with our partners, there is a flight to quality. This is where the power of the data that we have on our customers’ behalf and Lightbox that I’ve been talking about over the last couple of years come into play because with our partners and the flight to quality putting their Credit Karma models on our platform, they are actually able to really get the kind of quality customers that they need.',\n"," 'And so it’s just sort of a perfect match between members and partners, which is, by the way, why we saw the strength this past quarter of 48% growth and why the platform continues to be very resilient in these times.',\n"," 'So those would be, I would say, the headlines I would share with you about our platform being in need at probably some very unique times where our customers need us most.',\n"," 'Yes, great question. I would just start with – there is 86 million customers that are in the assisted category and the TAM is over at $20 billion, and we hit a major milestone this year of delivering $1 billion of revenue with TurboTax Live growing at 30%.',\n"," 'So we are in the very early stages of what’s possible in growth and penetration in the assisted category. That is really the long-term really bright spot and future growth for TurboTax, which we are very excited about.',\n"," 'You are very welcome.',\n"," 'And the only thing I would add is majority of our business, if not most of it, is highly predictable and for the most part, in some areas, it’s subscription, pretty much most of small business, which includes Mailchimp’s subscription.',\n"," 'So the predictability is quite high, and we are very sort of data-driven in terms of what we look at daily to see our performance. And as Michelle said, that, combined with the indicators that we see, the demand remains very strong on our platform.',\n"," 'Got it. Thank you both.',\n"," 'Maybe Keith, I’ll get – I didn’t know it was for Michelle. Michelle, go for it.',\n"," 'Well, you know how I am. I just jump in.',\n"," 'Alright. Alright. I’ll be quiet.',\n"," 'Yes. I’ll tell you, Keith, we are probably more excited today as we sit here than we were even when we made the announcement because now we’re into the work.

And very specifically, we’re focused on creating a growth platform.',\n"," 'So in one place, a customer can grow and run their business. And we now have proof points of the things that we’re starting to deliver like the customers and lead tab that’s in QuickBooks, where now we are transferring all of your customer and revenue data into a Mailchimp.',\n"," 'The second thing is really looking back the investment in marketing and knowing where to invest has been underwhelming. And that excites us as we look ahead, we’ve got some of our best marketing leadership teams now in Mailchimp and the investments that we are making in terms of one go-to-market strategy, pricing principles and how to invest is that we’re starting to see some green shoots. And with the investments that we’re making, and we’re quite good at these sorts of things. We foresee the financial results will be forthcoming and then last but not least, both going upmarket to mid-market and international.',\n"," 'In fact, we will talk more about this at Investor Day, but we have refreshed our international strategy, and a big part of that will actually include Mailchimp because of the fact that half of their business came from outside of the U.S. really with little effort.',\n"," 'So that was a long way of saying we’re quite excited about our momentum and we’re very excited about the trajectory of the business and sort of the best in terms of growth is yet to come. And I don’t think you’re going to be able to pick up the performance of Mailchimp through Google Trends.',\n"," 'Yes. Very welcome, Keith.',\n"," 'Yes, sure. Thanks for the question.',\n"," 'First of all, the last recession that we look back on, we actually grew 4%, and this is – I think this was in 2008, and we grew 4% where most of our peers actually declined.',\n"," 'And so we perform well in recessionary times. I would also then go on to say we are a totally different company today than when we were in 2008 in terms of the strength of our platform today versus in 2008. One, we now have a platform and by definition, we’re in the cloud, whereas back then, we’re primarily desktop.',\n"," 'We are in the cloud where the tailwinds around digitization, a shift to a virtual world, the shift to online, digitization to drive managing cash flow is actually essential for customers. And then you combine that with what I mentioned earlier with our Credit Karma platform where demand is actually higher in recessionary time. And our strength of our data and Lightbox capability makes them a great flight to quality for our partners, which is the current strength that we are seeing.',\n"," 'So we’d actually expect to perform better if it was exactly like-for-like compared to 2008. But nevertheless, those were the stats of the past recession and how we performed and we’re in a much stronger position today.',\n"," 'Yes. I would say the majority of really the growth is still coming from just the viral word-of-mouth nature of the platform and we are building out the capabilities of the platform.',\n"," 'One of the biggest things that we’ve learned now having the business as part of the company, is how much capabilities the platform has the customers don’t know about and how many customers don’t even know about Mailchimp because we’ve really never invested in marketing.',\n"," 'And so a lot of what we’re seeing is sort of just continued word of mouth because of the benefits that it delivers. With our investments in the product that I mentioned a moment ago, the investments that we are making strategically in marketing and that will accelerate over time. And then doing so going upmarket and international, we expect that will be accretive to growth as we head into the future. But most of it right now is just, I would say, word of mouth.',\n"," 'You are very welcome.',\n"," 'First and foremost, I would start with – these are both subscription-based businesses and together, they create magic. A part, one helps you manage your cash flow, which is QuickBooks, the other one helps you actually grow your business.',\n"," 'And so I would say that the demand and the strength of the demand, it’s fairly consistent for those customers, whether they are new or customers that have been in business for a while that realize that they have to find a way to market to their existing customers, to be able to grow with them and grow their wallet share and also find ways to market their business on different channels, whether it’s their website, whether it’s on Instagram, Facebook, Amazon, Etsy.',\n"," 'And so the demand is consistent. It depends on what you’re trying to do. And all businesses are trying to both grow their business and be able to run their business and manage the cash flow. And what they don’t have is the platform in one place nor do they have the data. And that’s why bringing Mailchimp and QuickBooks together will, over time, actually drive higher retention, a higher expansion of services and wallet share and also higher penetration because what we can do together is hard to do a part.',\n"," 'Got it. Thank you. And then turning to TurboTax real quick, when I think of some of my favorite differentiators for the product, I think of just auto importing the investments or TT Live and tool service. But it seems like a lot of the R&D work for those are done.',\n"," 'So I guess my question is, where are like the incremental investments going in terms of R&D for TurboTax now? Thank you.',\n"," 'First of all, there is no destination to the investments.',\n"," 'We are continuing to invest in machine learning and knowledge engineering to not only make the experts that are on our platform smarter so that we can lead how we answer questions through technology and not just through human labor. But two, in terms of how we do the matching and how we ensure that our – really our technology, the bots are engaging and answering the questions.',\n"," 'So we’re getting better at this every single day. And we’re going to continue to invest in that area.',\n"," 'I think the other thing I would say is around the money. The biggest thing that we learned this year where we’re excited about next year, it’s actually about everything in the assisted segment is about speed the tax is done and speed to my money.',\n"," 'And so the integration of Credit Karma into TurboTax where you can now get early access to your refund, that’s another area of investment for us because there is so much more we can do in the experience.',\n"," 'So it’s both getting you to a place where taxes are done and experts are smarter in terms of how they help you and also faster access to money and then being able to do that across very specific segments like investors, self-employed, Latinx and over time, the creator economy.',\n"," 'So our investments will continue in those areas. And remember, we invested the platform level and at the company level. These are not just investments within TurboTax, and they also benefit us in QuickBooks Live and other areas.',\n"," 'That’s awesome color. Thank you very much.',\n"," 'You are very welcome.',\n"," 'Yes. Thank you, Kash, and thank you for the question. I’ll use sort of tangible here and now answer so it doesn’t seem overly generic. I would just start with saying that we are most important in tougher times than just in good times. And I’ll start with small business. There is an accelerated flight to digitization to manage your cash flow as a small business in these tougher times. And we’re seeing that now. And the example I think I used earlier, but is worth bringing up again is in the month of April, our volume of QuickBooks Capital loans was at an all-time high and 3x higher than the same time last year, where times were much, much better compared to what environment all of us see today. And the other is our payments volume.',\n"," 'Just in the last month, in the last week, we are growing north of 30%. This is our payments volume.',\n"," 'So I use those as tangible examples just to state that we have truly become a growth platform and a money center for small businesses. And in times like this, we are in need, more than ever, because our capabilities are so different than the last time we were in a recession, because we have all the capabilities with Mailchimp and QuickBooks to grow your business and help you with your cash flow. And I will just maybe pause there with small business, and I will remind us that tax, both our ProTax and TurboTax business is more than 30% of the company, and it’s resilient in very tough times because people have to do their taxes. And then last but not least is demand is higher in recessionary times on the Credit Karma platform. And there is actually a flight to quality. And based on our data and Lightbox capability that’s proprietary, more and more partners are wanting to be on Lightbox because they can actually control the quality of their offers, and it makes our platform even more demand, which is what you saw in the last quarter.',\n"," 'And so I would foresee that playing forward, which I think was the nature of your question, we are the best positioned to serve consumers and small businesses in tough times and good times.',\n"," 'Yes. I wouldn’t be concerned at all.',\n"," 'If you look at our history, when the formations were high, when the formations were low or negative, it really – that’s not the driver of the long-term or short-term health of the business.',\n"," 'And so it is not something we worry about. It’s actually not something we track. It’s not something we talk about a lot.',\n"," 'And so you all start asking questions, got it.',\n"," 'So, I would just say that it is not an area of concern for us.',\n"," 'Yes. Thank you for the question. We don’t break out the specifics, but I will take you back to why we love the TurboTax Live platform. One, there is more than 10 million people in the assisted segment that actually a trip and go to another person to help them with assistance within – and these are directional numbers. Within TurboTax, there is probably more than 10 million people that log in, but never actually finish their taxes. And then there is switching that happens back and forth between doing it yourself and then getting assistance. The reason I bring up those three figures is there is actually a lot of sort of movement in the tens of millions in each category and across the category between do-it-yourself and the systems. And it’s all driven by a lack of confidence. Can I do this myself, did I do it right.',\n"," 'And so when we look at the TurboTax Live platform and in fact, I would say TurboTax as a whole, that’s why we are now a platform where you can do it yourself, we can do it with you or we can do it for you across the platform.',\n"," 'So, our growth in TurboTax Live comes from all those three areas. They are those that switch from assisted, they are those that would have left DIY that now stay with us and vice versa. It helps us with a funnel metrics.',\n"," 'So, that is the driver of where we are in TurboTax Live. That has been the driver looking backwards, and it will continue to be the driver looking ahead.',\n"," 'First of all, we are really focused on the money benefit for our customers. And for those that live paycheck to paycheck to get five days early access to their refund is really meaningful.',\n"," 'So, I am super proud of our team for what they are doing here and – because it really changes lives. With that said, we believe our hypothesis is, one, over time, this will actually help with TurboTax retention. These customers become new Credit Karma members. And then as you know, Credit Karma and the Credit Karma platform, we are really good at leveraging what we know about you with your permission to then really match you to financial products that are right for you and find ways to save money and get out of debt.',\n"," 'So, it’s new customers on a platform that already has over 120 million members that over time, as we engage them, we will be able to monetize. We do watch their behaviors. Do they keep the money on a Credit Karma Money, do they drain it, what we can help them with in terms of things they can do with that money to be able to build their credit.',\n"," 'So, it’s really – it truly feeds into the network effect of delivering benefits and the customers coming back for more benefits.',\n"," 'Yes. Thanks for the question.',\n"," 'First, I will start by saying our principles around acquisitions have not changed.',\n"," 'For us, it is all about time to market and having a platform that can fundamentally power the prosperity of consumers and small businesses that we serve. And secondarily, we expect excellence from ourselves and our teams, and we expect these acquisitions to be building the kind of momentum that we are building, and we are – we have a set of mechanisms within our Intuit operating system where we monitor very closely our progress against the deliverables, and I mean the product and marketing deliverables and the talent on the team and their engagement to really ensure that things are on track. And really, everything with both of these acquisitions is about acceleration. We only integrate as long as it accelerates.',\n"," 'And so we have a very I would say, good playbook in terms of how to make acquisitions. And in both cases, when you look at Credit Karma and Mailchimp, we bought the capabilities and the incredible talent because they do things that we are not great at and there are things we do that they are not great at and together as a family, we can create magic.',\n"," 'So, with all of that said, it doesn’t accelerate or decelerate what we are looking at from a time-to-market perspective, they are both on track in terms of our expectations. And we are very discrete in terms of how we allocate mind share and resources to both of these assets. And frankly, the biggest hindrance for future acquisitions is how good their management team is. It is not our mind share or our resources.',\n"," 'So, that’s the way we think about it.',\n"," 'Yes, it’s a really good question.',\n"," 'First of all, I would tell you, having sort of experimented with our TurboTax Live basic offer is a good experiment and it worked. The biggest thing that I would tell you that we learned in this – particularly this last year is what really matters is speed to your taxes done with an expert and speed the money. And that is an area where we are doubling down going into next year because the majority of these customers, they want their taxes done right by an expert or if you do it for them and they want access to their money as soon as possible, both of which we can deliver on.',\n"," 'And so really, in that context, folks that use an assisted method generally have more complex situation. And we would expect, over time, the higher SKUs that we have to play a bigger role when it comes to TurboTax Live.',\n"," 'That’s helpful there. And Sasan, just to the earlier point you made earlier on the call just on international. Have you seen any change in terms of trends of new customer growth or even top of funnel with either QuickBooks and Mailchimp when you look internationally versus maybe more in the U.S.?',\n"," 'Yes. What is consistent is what I have shared before, which is, I would say, U.S. and Canada, and I will just use COVID as an example, coming out of – we are not out of COVID, but coming out of sort of the world shutting down, bounce back much faster than the other countries that we are in. In the UK, in Australia and France, there has been so many sort of start, stop, start-stop, that it’s impacted the sort of building momentum in that country. And I don’t mean to us, I just mean how consumers and small businesses thinking about managing their financial life.',\n"," 'So, they are starting to bounce back, but they, for sure, are tracking behind the U.S. and Canada. And again, I will say that what it really excites us looking ahead is the possibilities to help customers grow their customers in small business with Mailchimp. That will be a bigger part of our future as we roll out our strategy and game plan and we believe that, that will be over the long-term, accretive to our growth.',\n"," 'That’s helpful. Thanks for taking my questions.',\n"," 'Yes. Thank you very much.',\n"," 'Yes. Sure, Scott. Well, first of all, I will start with the headline, which is there could be. But now let me give you more specifics with the guidance and what we are talking to you about is for our fiscal year, which is through the end of July. And I will start at the top. The IRS returns through July, we are observing that it will be down three points, and it’s driven by stimulus filers that didn’t come back. About 30% of them were actually paying customers and IRS extensions being up. And in our base, they are nearly doubled.',\n"," 'And so we have made some assumptions in terms of what will happen through July. And of course, we will talk to you all more as we talk about our guidance for next fiscal year because we have not made those estimates, and we won’t communicate it today because our focus was what we communicate to you through July. But certainly, the extensions, most of those customers at some point come back, and – but we have not estimated what that will be after July. And we do expect just – so it said again that IRS total returns will be more normal next year because, in essence, this year, we are digesting what happened in the last 2 years because of all the stimulus filers and we would expect it to be more back to the normal flat or up as we look into the future.',\n"," 'Let me start with the latter part of your question. When we look at the assisted category where there is more than a $20 billion TAM, and by the way, there is another $10 billion TAM, which is business tax that we have not talked about.',\n"," 'So, in total, it’s $30 billion. TurboTax Live is $1 billion.',\n"," 'And so we have got a lot of runway. And as you have heard me talk in prior years, we are sort of in the early days, and we got a 10-year run here, hopefully, now that we have divulged how big TurboTax Live is, you can see how much runway we have.',\n"," 'So, there is a lot of runway there. There is also a lot of runway in our underpenetrated segments.',\n"," 'We are truly just getting started with Latinx, self-employed and the investor segment because we are actually under-shared in those segments based on all the data that we see.',\n"," 'And so when we look at those segments, which is both do-it-yourself and in the assisted segment, we also have an equal runway. And we believe, down the road, the creator community – the creator segment will continue to become a larger part of those that choose to do taxes, and that’s an area where we will be focused over time as well.',\n"," 'So, that was a long answer to your short question.',\n"," 'I think the headline I would leave you with is, yes, there is a runway for sure. And it’s a multiyear runway in all of those areas.',\n"," 'Yes. Thanks for the question. And I will start with the first part of what you led with. When we look at the last 3 years and even more historically, IRS returns has been up about 1% and the DIY category has grown about 0.5 point.',\n"," 'And so when you look at the last 3 years with all the anomalies, that also holds true. And the way we keep score is our share of the total IRS returns with respect to just now the platform that we have, where you can do it yourself or we will do it for you on the other spectrum. But specifically to answer your question, we do believe over time that the DIY category will continue to grow just as it has grown historically.',\n"," 'So, we do believe that this is just I would say, a year where we are digesting all of the anomalies in the last 2 years.',\n"," 'We have over 120 partners on our platform and these partners, they are big and they are small. And with that as context, are always experimenting and adjusting both in good times and not so good times, their credit cycle and they jump between bands, whether they are more interested in those that have a credit band below 620, which is subprime or between 620 to 700, which is prime or near prime and then, of course, anything over 700, which is prime. And the point is, based on our platform and the demand on our platform and the supply on our platform, we see very good supply across all of the bands because of the focus areas of the partners.',\n"," 'And so that drives the strength that we saw this last quarter, and we would expect it going forward in context of our guidance.',\n"," 'Yes, Brad, great question because we are actually – we are done with our 3-year and 1-year plan and the way our cycle works is while we are in the heat of delivering this year, we finish our planning for next year. We look at a few things. One, we look at secular trends. We look at facts and figures on our platform.',\n"," 'So, the secular trends are what I have mentioned earlier, which is a shift to using virtual solutions, an acceleration to online and omnichannel and an acceleration to using digital money platform.',\n"," 'So, we look at secular shifts and we look at the facts and figures around the secular shifts. We then look at all the things that actually happened on our platform and our share. If I just use a couple of examples, we have over $1.5 trillion of invoices that are generated on our small business platform. But as we shared last Investor Day and of course, this number is bigger now, our payments volume was over $90 billion.',\n"," 'And so you look at – that’s a very low share. When you look at our share of the assisted category in tax, very low share, when you look at our share of financial products on Credit Karma, credit cards, personal loans, very low share.',\n"," 'So, we look at data around our share and our performance around our share. And then we will also look at economic factors like unemployment, like default rates, like projections around the economy. By the way, we are the best projector of the economy because of the data that we see on our small business platform.',\n"," 'So, we look at all of those things. And then the way we put in – put together our plan is sort of worst case, middle case, best case. And that’s how we manage the company. And by the way, this is something that we are quite good at. And then we manage based on the data that we see, we managed to ensure that we are protecting our long-term investor investments while we deliver for today for our customers.',\n"," 'So, that’s a little bit of a snapshot in terms of how we think about it.',\n"," 'So, I will. Hey, thank you, everyone, for making the time. Thank you for all your wonderful questions.',\n"," 'As I said earlier, I am super proud of our employees across the company and our partners, and it’s a real privilege and honor to be able to serve our members and customers in these unique times.',\n"," 'And so all of you be safe, be well, and we will talk to you soon. Thank you.',\n"," 'For the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we delivered revenue of $5.6 billion, up 35%, including 6 points from the addition of Mailchimp, GAAP operating income of $2.4 billion versus $1.9 billion last year, non-GAAP operating income of $2.9 billion versus $2.2 billion last year, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $6.28 versus $5.30 a year ago and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $7.65 versus $6.07 last year. On May 4, we entered into a settlement agreement with the State Attorneys General regarding our advertising practices related to free tax preparation. This resulted in a $141 million onetime charge in our fiscal third quarter. Under the terms of the settlement, we admitted no wrongdoing.',\n"," 'We are pleased to put this issue behind us so we can continue to focus on delivering innovative solutions for our customers.',\n"," 'Excluding the settlement charge, our fiscal third quarter GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin would have been 250 basis points higher, and GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $0.37 and $0.38 higher, respectively.',\n"," 'Turning to the business segments, Consumer Group revenue was $3.2 billion, up 32%, reflecting the earlier IRS tax filing deadline this year. I’m proud of our execution this season as we expect to gain share and grow our average revenue per return. There are four primary drivers of our consumer business. This data reflects our expectations through July 31, 2022 versus the prior year through July 31, 2021.',\n"," 'The first is the total number of returns filed with the IRS. We now expect total returns to decline 3% this year, below our original expectations.

The fourth is average revenue per return, which we expect to increase this year, driven by a mix shift to TurboTax Live and our premier offering used by investors as well as fewer free customers.',\n"," 'As a result of the weaker IRS returns, we now expect total customer growth of 1%, including TurboTax Online paying customer growth of 8% this year.',\n"," 'We expect the base of customers paying us nothing in our commercial-free offering to decline 11% this year to just over 13 million from over 14 million last year.

Online Ecosystem revenue grew 67% or 31% excluding MailChimp.',\n"," 'With the aim of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within the Small Business and Self-Employed Group is threefold: grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally.',\n"," 'First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online Accounting revenue grew 32% in fiscal Q3, driven mainly by higher effective prices, customer growth and mix shift.',\n"," 'Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue, which includes Mailchimp, payroll, payments, capital and time tracking, grew 121% in fiscal Q3.',\n"," 'Excluding MailChimp, online services revenue grew 28%. MailChimp revenue recorded in online services was $257 million in the quarter, and this was in line with our expectations. Within payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects growth in payroll customers and a mix shift to our full-service offering. Within payments, revenue growth reflects an increase in charge volume per customer and ongoing customer growth.',\n"," 'Third, we continue to make progress expanding globally. Total international Online Ecosystem revenue grew 221% in fiscal Q3 on a constant currency basis and 29% on an organic basis, excluding MailChimp. We believe the best measure of the health and success of our strategy is online ecosystem revenue growth, which we expect to grow better than 30% organically over time. This is driven by 10% to 20% expected growth in both customers and ARPC. Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 3% in the third quarter. QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew mid-teens, driven by strong customer growth and price increases. Longer term, we don’t expect the desktop business to be a growth driver for the Small Business and Self-Employed Group.',\n"," 'Moving on to Credit Karma, revenue grew 48% to $468 million in Q3, another record revenue quarter, driven primarily by growth in average revenue per monthly active user.

We finished the quarter with approximately $3.9 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet. We repurchased $489 million of stock during the third quarter.

But no, you know we have our financial principles, first of all.',\n"," 'So our financial principles to grow revenue double digits and grow operating income faster than revenue.',\n"," 'We haven’t set out any target for what that margin expansion might look like over time. But we do see that it is possible because of the benefits of being on – having the platform that we do.',\n"," 'And so besides being able to innovate more quickly and deliver for our customers, we do continue to see those opportunities as you’re seeing this year that we can really leverage key services and capabilities across our business whether that be in technology or customer success or sales and marketing, we do continue to see an opportunity there, although we have not given any type of specific range of what that expansion might look like.',\n"," 'Katy, thank you, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us today. UnitedHealth Group ended the second half of the year with sustained momentum as we execute on our objective to serve more people more effectively with connected high-quality care.',\n"," \"For that, I want to thank our 360,000 colleagues. It's their unwavering commitment to our mission and their hard work and support of the people we serve that makes all of this possible.\",\n"," \"As a result of the strong performance at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare, we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share outlook for the year to a range of $21.40 to $21.90 per share. Comprehensive value-based care is a central theme of our growth strategy, helping more patients and care providers transition from traditional fee-for-service to a value-based orientation. We aim to drive better and more consistent care outcomes at lower overall cost, often for people who are among society's most vulnerable with multiple chronic conditions, limited income and unmet social needs. Optum Health and Optum Rx's clinical platforms span a continuum of care settings, from virtual to post-acute, in-clinic and at home, enabling our care teams to meet patients' unique needs by providing personalized connected care.\",\n"," 'Our approach helps patients stick with their prescribed care programs, allowing them to spend more time in the comfort of their own homes. The high consumer satisfaction with this comprehensive and consumer-focused approach is evidenced, for example, by a Net Promoter Score of 80 for the 1.5 million people served by our Dual Special Needs Plans. We again delivered growth across our health benefits offerings this quarter.',\n"," \"As you might expect, right now, our Medicare teams are finalizing offerings for this fall's open enrollment, focused, as always, on delivering more value, stability and predictability for seniors. Throughout the year, we gather extensive consumer broker and market feedback to continually improve our products.\",\n"," 'Our approach is grounded in providing deep customer engagement, high-touch service and access to the best care. The benefits of this approach are striking. People served by Medicare Advantage spend about 40% less out of pocket than those participating in fee-for-service, which translates into savings of about $2,000 each year for seniors, most of whom are on limited income. And compared to traditional fee-for-service, Medicare Advantage plans devote up to 30% more in resources to primary care and perform up to 50% more preventative screening and testing services for their seniors. The response among seniors in our plans is positive. Plan satisfaction ratings have risen by 450 basis points over the past 5 years, nearly twice that of the industry. Consumer satisfaction is best demonstrated by the almost 3.4 million additional seniors who have chosen our plans over the same period. Meanwhile, in our domestic commercial health business -- benefits business, over the past 12 months, we have grown to serve over 250,000 more people as a result of innovation in and expansion of our products, including our digital-first offerings. To continue driving affordability in areas of greatest need, we are announcing today an important initiative from UnitedHealthcare, supported by Optum Rx. Starting in 2023, there will be no co-pay, $0 out of pocket for several critical medicines on our preferred drug list for UnitedHealthcare Group fully insured members. Included are medicines such as insulin, epinephrine for severe allergic reactions, and albuterol for acute asthma attacks.',\n"," \"While this is an important step for vulnerable people's health, the larger and longer-term cost containment of drugs depends upon manufacturers restraining and lowering the list price of their products, which is a fundamental driver of costs.\",\n"," \"We will continue to use our capabilities to do everything we can to lower out-of-pocket costs for consumers, building on past actions, including point-of-sale discounts. Stepping back and looking across each of our 5 growth areas, you'll see a common theme: The deepening of our relationships with the consumers served by Optum and UnitedHealthcare. Throughout 2022, we've been rapidly expanding and accelerating investments in capabilities to reach and serve a broader base of consumers ever more effectively. This includes further enhancing our digital experiences to help consumers find trusted, health-related information and drive greater engagement with our direct-to-consumer platforms.\",\n"," \"Now, I'd like to turn it over to Dirk McMahon, our President and Chief Operating Officer, to share more about these efforts. Dirk?\",\n"," 'Before the Q&A, let me underscore a few key points.',\n"," 'First, the strong momentum throughout our business. The people we serve are continually seeking value, high-quality care at fair cost, and our colleagues across Optum and UnitedHealthcare are raising the bar every day.',\n"," \"You see that manifested in our business performance and the strong growth in our core platforms, double-digit growth across the Benefits businesses, a growing revenue backlog in Optum Insight, robust growth in our pharmacy services and expansion across Optum Health. We see tremendous opportunity ahead, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver our long-term 13% to 16% earnings per share growth objective and further advance our mission to help people live healthier lives and to help make the health system work better for everyone. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions. One per caller, please.\",\n"," 'A.J., thanks so much for the question.',\n"," \"So first off, before I hand this to Brian Thompson to give you a few thoughts, we've been super pleased with the progression, particularly across the benefits business, as you've seen in the report this morning. But certainly within our E&I business, the commercial business had a very strong year. And I think the team have worked extremely hard to understand the kind of pressures you're describing as employers are obviously concerned about managing their own cost environment and how we make sure that the benefits availability for their employees are appropriate. Really, I would say, take just this opportunity just to emphasize how important the role of a company like UnitedHealthcare is here. Because as we all know, we're in a more inflationary environment. The role of UnitedHealthcare to help deliver affordability, affordable healthcare coverage to the employees of all of those companies that rely on it is super important. And maybe with that, I'll hand it to Brian to give you a little bit more sense of how things are playing out.\",\n"," 'Brian, thanks so much. And A.J., thank you again.',\n"," 'Next question, please.',\n"," 'Justin, thanks so much for the question.',\n"," \"Before I ask John to maybe comment a little bit on the business cost evolution and then Brian, I think will give you a little bit of perspective of what they're seeing in terms of hospital conversation, just a couple of step back observations maybe I would offer here.\",\n"," 'First off, as we look across the overall business, we are seeing tremendous growth opportunities and tremendous potential for us to invest behind those. And you see that picked up in some of the increase in investment levels that you see in the quarter this time around.',\n"," \"I think that's an incredibly positive sign of the forward potential of the overall organization. John will talk a little bit more to some of those in a second.\",\n"," 'I think in terms of 2023, we are not going to get into a ton of detail on how we are thinking about pricing. But as always, we are very, very respectful of the kind of underlying phenomena within the cost trends of the environment.',\n"," \"Of course, that includes a sense of where COVID may or may not be. And I think we have all learned to be deeply respectful of something like a pandemic and the uncertainties it can present. And even in the last few months we have seen that play out a little bit. And of course, respectful of things like inflationary trends in the environment and all of that plays into how we think about these things. Maybe just to give you a little bit more depth on the first part of your question, I'll pass it to John, and then maybe John, you could pass it to Brian, just to finish off on the second part.\",\n"," 'Justin. Appreciate it.',\n"," 'Next question, please.',\n"," 'Ricky, yes, great. Ricky, thanks so much for the question.',\n"," \"Before I ask Heather to make a few comments on that, I think one of the overwhelming census that we see around Optum Rx is the really strong growth and the bringing on board of very significant new clients. And of course, that, as you know, brings with it a kind of front-loading investment phenomenon as you gear up for supporting that, and that's one of the reasons why you see this lag between the revenue growth and the earnings growth. And maybe to give you a little bit more of a sense of all of that and other aspects, Heather?\",\n"," 'Great. Thanks, Heather, and Ricky, thank you for the question.',\n"," 'Next question, please.',\n"," \"Matt, thanks very much for the question. I mean, I think not to be too disappointing too, but I don't think you'd be too surprised that we don't generally comment on ongoing legal processes. And I think in this case, that certainly applies.\",\n"," 'So not really in a position to be able to give you too much information on that, but certainly appreciate the question.',\n"," 'Next question, please.',\n"," \"Scott, thanks so much for the question. And listen, let me start off by saying we really believe that enhancing and building high-quality care provision in the home is going to be a key feature of the future. And the more that that can be linked to other aspects of care, so for example, physician clinic, virtual and the rest, it's very much a central focus of our Optum Health development.\",\n"," \"And so the bringing together of LHC within the overall Optum organization is really important to us, and we're very committed to that transaction. We believe it really is going to be a significant enhancement of the quality of care that can be delivered. And we think we can really -- it can really contribute towards improved value-based delivery for patients.\",\n"," 'I think, as is always the case, making sure that the incentive system is appropriate to drive the right kind of care is really important.',\n"," 'So I hope very much over time that CMS and others continue to see the value of home care and that, in fact, the support is given and the signals are given to continue to increase the development of high-quality care in the home environment.',\n"," \"And so we'll see how that plays out. Honestly, we are committed to this agenda very much because we see it as a strategically critical way of extending better care to folks in homes. And you have to remember, Scott, some of these folks can't get out of their homes. I mean, this is really -- this isn't kind of elective for them. They need -- we need to find ways to get more help to them. And as you know, we've got a long history in this in areas like house calls, which have delivered amazing health assessment and preventive direction to millions of people, and this is another big step for us to extend.\",\n"," \"So we're optimistic about this. We hope very much that CMS and others will continue to send signals of support through the way in which they choose to invest in this arena, and we'll see how that plays out during the rest of the year. Thanks so much for the question.\",\n"," 'Next question, please.',\n"," \"Lisa, thanks so much for the question. And I think UHC supported by Optum Rx are doing the completely right thing here to bring $0 co-pay and $0 out of pocket on some critical meds. And you've got to think about the consequences of folks who are unfortunately affected by the conditions that these meds address. If they don't get the meds when they need them, they're going to end up in the emergency room or worse. And that brings with enormous personal human consequence and, of course, cost.\",\n"," 'And so we believe this is a really appropriate place for us to lean in and to address that.',\n"," 'In terms of -- before I go to Heather to talk about specifically Optum Rx selling season, I just want to step back for a second. I just want to let you know, Optum is in the middle of a record selling season across the board.',\n"," 'If you look at the first 6 months of Optum, it, of course, including Optum Rx, but also the other 2 businesses, that we are in a record selling season.',\n"," \"So this is a really significant period for us in terms of the fit of the products and services that we're offering across the marketplace.\",\n"," \"One of the reasons why you've seen a step up our investment profile in the business is because we're seeing such a strong pickup in our services. And maybe with that, Heather, you could address specifically what you're seeing in Optum Rx as you think about selling seasons into '23? And maybe also just touch on the value-based care aspect that Lisa described.\",\n"," \"Heather, thanks so much. And Lisa, I think you're really right to focus us on this value-based piece. And as Heather just said, rather than it being an Optum Rx kind of standalone agenda, it's very much an Optum agenda, right, in terms of how we build value-based care propositions. And of course, you've seen that very substantially within -- in the primary care, kind of holistic approach that Optum Health is leading on.\",\n"," \"You'll continue to see us prospect experiment and invest in areas like behavioral health and in areas like oncology, and these are going to be important areas for us to solve. Right now, I'd say those are early day opportunities. But as you think about where the burden of cost and complexity sits in the healthcare environment, those are the kind of places where we need to make progress, and we are. And you should expect to hear much more from us on that over the next 2 or 3 years. Lisa, thanks so much.\",\n"," 'Yes, Josh, great question. Really appreciate it. And we continue to see a very strong performance in our senior book of business.',\n"," \"You see that continued progression toward 800,000 folks joining us this year for the first time. That's really important, continued market share growth. And all of that is built on the stability of the service offering that we're giving. And I think the experience that the seniors are taking. But you're totally right to ask the question about where next. And maybe Tim Noel, you could speak to that?\",\n"," \"Tim, thanks so much. And I think maybe there was a little glitch with Tim's mic at the beginning of his comments.\",\n"," 'So I hope very much you were able to hear him, and certainly hear the latter part of his commentary. And I think the sense of urgency and depth of thinking around innovation for our senior members and where that service can go over the next several years is really substantive, and you should continue to see us be super active in that space. Josh, I really appreciate the question.',\n"," 'Next question, please.',\n"," \"Great questions, Kevin. I'm going to ask John in a second to talk to the margin progression opportunity. But maybe first, Dr. Decker, Head of Optum Health, might speak to the whole dynamic around physician recruitment?\",\n"," 'John, thank you very much. Kevin, I appreciate the question.',\n"," 'Next question, please.',\n"," 'Yes. Well, thanks so much.',\n"," 'Let me hand it straight to John.',\n"," 'Thanks, John, and thanks, Whit.',\n"," 'Next question, please.',\n"," \"So I'll ask John to make a few comments on this in a second, but I'm glad you saw that substantial continued deployment of our capital to grow the business.\",\n"," \"As you know, a key part of our long-term growth strategy is, of course, organic and complemented by bringing on board new businesses and teams who can supplement what we have. And there's nothing more powerful to that agenda than building out the value-based care piece.\",\n"," 'Now we believe in both Atrius and Kelsey-Seybold organizations.',\n"," 'We have amazing teams, people, organizations which have got real character, history, personality of themselves that we think is going to really add to the diversity of the company and bringing with it a tremendous amount of skills and perspective. And as you know, a number of them already -- in both cases, they have developed themselves some significant thinking around value-based care, so the fit is really good.',\n"," \"Of course, when you bring in new organizations, there's typically a further in process before they fully contribute, and I'm sure that will be the case here as well. But really, we continue to be extremely active in how we sensibly think about deploying capital, and we remain very optimistic about our ability to do that. But maybe go a little further around valuation perspective, John?\",\n"," 'Absolutely. Gary, thank you so much for the question. We just have time for one last question.',\n"," 'So final question, please, operator.',\n"," \"Nate, thanks so much for the question. I'm maybe going to go to Brian in a couple of minutes just to give you a little bit of what he's seeing and what is kind of reflected in his membership. But listen, obviously, we all see the inflationary pressures around us, and we all know that that has -- that really focuses people's minds on how they prioritize their spend and investment. What it really means for us is we have to double down on getting a great deal for them.\",\n"," \"We have to use our capabilities to get the very best quality care available at the most affordable cost. And whether that's through the PBM, whether that's through the UnitedHealthcare negotiations with the rest of the medical environment. That's a really important role we're stepping into play, and we're going to continue to lean into that very much.\",\n"," \"Now then, it speaks to really being astute around understanding how within the consumer experience, some things are more problematic than others. And I'll call out one of the things we're announcing today to eliminate those co-pays on for people who are in really vulnerable situation. This is the right time to do that, to help those folks who are struggling, and we know that we need those folks to make sure they fill their prescriptions properly. And if there's anything caused by the inflationary environment that might hold that back, there's going to be really bad downside there. And we don't want that to happen.\",\n"," \"So we will lean into that. I'd call out things like virtual, call out things as you think about much more digital engagement. Call out choice. I mean, giving consumers more choice. The more pressure there is in the environment, you've got to lean into it. And that's why, as an organization, we have over the last 2 years really doubled down on our commitment to consumer strategy across the board. Core capability of this company going forward will be consumer capability. And that's an area where you will see us continue to talk about, invest in, build, innovate and we hope really lead in terms of moving the consumer to the center of thinking in healthcare. And maybe just to finish off, Brian, would love to get your perspective on what you're seeing from your very significant membership.\",\n"," 'Thanks so much. And Nate, thank you very, very much for that question.',\n"," 'We certainly appreciate your time and attention today. And I hope what you heard is the story of growth and focused execution.',\n"," \"As our strategy continues to generate momentum across our businesses and advance our mission on behalf of every person and every community, we're privileged to serve. Really grateful for your attention this morning. Thank you so much for your questions. We look forward to following up as usual with any further questions you might have offline. Thanks so much, and have a great day.\",\n"," \"Thank you, Andrew. Picking up on Andrew's comments, I want to provide you with a little more color on the progress we have been making on our growth strategies. This progress is evidenced by -- is evidenced in our work to serve more people through value-based arrangements and to deliver better care.\",\n"," 'We are well along in our goals for the year. This expansion has significant implications for clinical quality and consistency. MA patients in value-based arrangements with Optum Care physicians are more engaged in their care, with adherence to wellness checks running 5 points higher than Medicare fee-for-service patients, helping to deliver a nearly 20% lower hospitalization rate. Further, Optum Care COPD patients served in our value-based arrangements have 80% higher medication adherence rates than Medicare fee-for-service patients, contributing to about 60% fewer respiratory complications, enabling people to avoid emergency room visits. Clinical results like these are a small part of the track record we have built in delivering value-based care at a substantial scale for years now, and what gives real urgency to our work to expand access to such care.',\n"," 'We also remain committed as an organization to improving access by driving down the cost of healthcare through applied technology.',\n"," 'For example, we are investing hundreds of millions of dollars to enhance the technology backbone of healthcare. Areas such as platform rationalization to reduce unnecessary complexities, greater end-to-end eligibility management for a more seamless customer experience, and a common platform to facilitate a consistent clinical experience for our consumers and providers. These investments will ultimately lead to an enhanced end-to-end service experience, lower overall operating cost and greater value for people we serve. A simpler experience is at the center of our work on the integrated consumer card developed by our Optum financial services team.',\n"," 'We have seen great consumer response within our initial pilot groups. The simplicity of combining all benefits, even healthy food purchases onto a single widely-accepted card has been a differentiator with consumers. Based on this initial work, we intend to introduce the card to all our individual Medicare Advantage members in 2023.',\n"," \"Another key element of our work to improve experience is the optimization of consumer transactions. We know members need and expect timely information at their fingertips, and I'm pleased to report they are responding well to our digital offerings for everything from understanding their coverage to completing a virtual visit. Digital engagement has jumped 170% among Medicare members during the last couple of years.\",\n"," 'Lastly, in pharmacy services, we are very focused on improving quality of care and access for consumers by driving pharmacist-led offerings.',\n"," \"We are on track to have nearly 700 community pharmacies by the end of the year and continue to increase the integrated community pharmacy footprint in our clinical locations. With that, now I'll turn it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex.\",\n"," 'As Andrew noted, we entered the second half of this year with strong growth momentum.',\n"," 'First half revenues of over $160 billion grew 13% compared to last year. Performance was well balanced, with double-digit growth at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. To begin, let me touch briefly on the care patterns we have observed so far this year. Principally, we have seen what had been a balanced relationship between COVID and non-COVID care activity over the past couple of years diverge modestly, with the latter not returning quite as rapidly with lower levels of COVID care.',\n"," 'We also continue to see some variation in underlying care patterns, with certain areas remaining below historical levels.',\n"," 'For example, pediatrics and emergency department. And others coming back more fully, such as the levels at which seniors are obtaining important preventative care. In recent weeks, we are seeing rising COVID-related hospital admissions but with a lower average length of stay compared with earlier periods.',\n"," 'As always, we watch closely for longer-term health impacts on people due to care, which might have been deferred during earlier periods. Thus far, we are still not seeing patterns, which indicate shifting acuity. There are, of course, many reasonable theories about what is driving the current environment, and they are all no doubt interesting. But here is what we are actually doing. Consistent with the long-standing practice at UnitedHealth Group, our primary intent is to ensure people are getting the care they need and to help them in that process as much as we can. We remain, as always, highly respectful of medical cost trends and how they can evolve rapidly, and we will continue to position our offerings accordingly.',\n"," 'Moving now to the businesses. Optum Health revenue grew by over $4 billion or 32% in the second quarter. Revenue per consumer increased 30%, led by growth in patients served under value-based arrangements. Earnings from operations rose 24% even as we accelerated investments in our care delivery practices to support value-based expansions.',\n"," \"We also saw strong contributions from Optum's ambulatory surgery centers, which continue to advance the scope and complexity of procedures performed in these optimal settings, all while delivering a superior patient and surgeon experience and high-quality clinical outcomes.\",\n"," 'Our centers have nearly tripled the number of high-acuity joint, spine and cardiovascular procedures performed compared to just 2 years ago. Care providers increasingly recognize the benefits these centers offer, and consumers place high value on the care quality and experience, with an NPS consistently in excess of 90. Optum Insight revenue grew 11% year-over-year. The revenue backlog was $23.6 billion, growth of $2.3 billion compared to last year.',\n"," 'We continue to drive technological advancements, applying artificial intelligence and machine learning more deeply in high-value knowledge-based services, including an expanding suite of information technology and data analytics offerings. Optum Rx revenues grew 10% to nearly $25 billion, reflecting continued strong sales results and execution in the core PBM as well as our growth in our pharmacy care services. These vital and expanding care offerings serve and improve the health of people, including in such areas as our high-touch specialty services where we tightly monitor and track the effectiveness of complex treatments.',\n"," 'Turning to UnitedHealthcare. Revenue grew by a strong $6.6 billion or 12%, with contributions from all our businesses. In our offerings for seniors, we continue to expect to serve up to 800,000 additional people within Medicare Advantage this year. About 3/4 will be an individual and group Medicare Advantage and the remainder in Dual Special Needs Plans. This puts us on track for our seventh consecutive year of share gaining growth in Medicare Advantage. People served by our Medicaid offerings grew by 180,000 in the second quarter. At this point, we anticipate the impact to Medicaid enrollment as a result of state redetermination activities will be experienced next year.',\n"," 'We continue to prepare resources to help people find uninterrupted access to appropriate coverage as this transition occurs. We added 80,000 new people in domestic commercial plans during the quarter. Within that, fully-insured commercial offerings grew by 60,000 from the first quarter of this year, with balanced growth across group and individual fully-insured offerings. Of note, some 90% of the growth within our individual and family plans was among people who chose a plan featuring convenient and cost-effective access to virtual visits.',\n"," 'Our capital capacities remain strong.',\n"," 'Second quarter cash flows from operations were $6.9 billion or 1.3x net income, and we continue to expect full year cash flows of about $24 billion. In the first half of this year, we returned nearly $8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. In June, our Board increased the dividend by 14%, and we deployed more than $7 billion in capital to enhance our care delivery capacity and consumer strategies to improve outcomes and experiences for the people we serve and for the benefit of the broader health system.',\n"," 'As noted earlier, based on this growth outlook, today, we increased our adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $21.40 to $21.90 per share.',\n"," \"Now, I'll turn it back to Andrew.\",\n"," 'Sure. Good morning, Justin.',\n"," 'Just a few thoughts, and in particular, maybe we will look at some of the observations really from the quarter from the first half and what we have seen because this influences really what you are getting at and asking how our thinking is developing.',\n"," \"So, you heard in my prepared comments talked about that we had typically seeing a very balanced relationship between COVID care and non-COVID care over the course of the last two years, and that's what shifted a little bit here in recent months that the lower level of COVID care. And let's put that in the second quarter, probably about 1/3, the number of inpatient admissions as compared to the first quarter. It was not as quickly accompanied by a higher level of non-COVID utilization.\",\n"," 'So, that was an important kind of underlying factor here that we saw in recent months.',\n"," \"I think the other important thing here is, and as you look across care broadly, we've gone longer really between intervals and COVID hospitalizations that any other point since the pandemic now.\",\n"," 'So that further illuminates the core underlying non-COVID care patterns that we are seeing also.',\n"," \"So helping illuminate what's going on underneath all of that.\",\n"," \"I think the other point that I wanted to speak to that we are seeing, we've been very encouraged that we are seeing some pockets of care moving towards more normal levels. Ones that we would say are kind of bellwethers for future care, an important -- for example, super important for us. Annual wellness visits among our Medicare patients, they're back at pre-pandemic baseline. That's very important for us in getting them the care they need.\",\n"," \"First fill prescriptions are trending above baseline a little bit, so we're seeing people get some care they need. We're seeing important pickups in some preventative care such as colonoscopies, also those now getting back to baseline.\",\n"," \"So all that kind of influencing in terms of how we think about the future. We got to make sure people are getting the care that they need. We've seen the greatest response really in our senior populations.\",\n"," 'I think some of that is our ability to get into their homes to influence that care and to get them into that. And certainly, back to your kind of core fundamental in how we think about the future, yes, enormously respectful of the outlook for future impacts from COVID hospitalizations.',\n"," \"Here we are sitting in a period where we're seeing COVID hospitalizations rise again after kind of pausing since January.\",\n"," 'So super respectful in our outlook towards how that might progress throughout this year and next, and the potential for that to continue to be somewhat variable and to accelerate again. Brian?',\n"," \"Good morning, Kevin, it's John here.\",\n"," \"So considering the growth in Optum Health and the earnings progression that you should expect out of that, the primary focus continues to be on expanding our capabilities for value-based care, that build out. These investments, as you know well because you've looked at this for a while, are made well in advance of any revenue impact that we get from bringing those physicians on.\",\n"," \"As we look at our pipeline, so when I talk pipeline, there are 2 ways to think about it. It's both potential future ads. But when I'm talking about it now with you here, I'm talking about even our existing base of clinical care delivery capabilities and where we have to build out that capability in terms of future value-based expansion. We're still quite early stage in that, which is why we hang in this 8% to 10% margin range for Optum Health, view being here that there is a decade ahead of build for us, so. And just when you look at our existing pipeline and what that can drive in terms of strong double-digit top line growth for many years as we bring this on. And the importance, in particular because of the value it brings to the patients we serve, of continuing to invest in these value-based capabilities.\",\n"," \"So as we build along this, you'll see as we try to do this, we try to -- we look to deliver in this 8% to 10% margin range. And I expect that to continue just because of these deep investments and still considering this very early innings, third inning in terms of the build that we'd like to see looking ahead for care delivery.\",\n"," \"Good morning, Whit. Yes, within the quarter, we actually took -- we realized some losses as we reposition the portfolio a bit here, looking out to the future, try to get that all teed up for the environment we're in right now.\",\n"," \"And so when you look at that, the quarterly progression, which I believe that's what you're focusing on, I'd call it some of the realized losses we chose to take in this quarter.\",\n"," \"As it relates to valuation perspective, I mean, our pipeline and our conversations as we expand in care delivery, these are multiyear conversations that we have. Often by the time we are able to partner with another care delivery organization, we've probably been in conversations with them for 5 years. Super long pipelines, development processes, relationships, understanding the organization. That is us understanding their organization, them understanding us. These go on for quite a long period of time.\",\n"," \"So with that perspective there, there's probably a little bit less volatility than you might expect in terms of as we pace out and we think about valuations in this business and where we would have stepped into it maybe a number of years ago where we are now. And even if you look towards a public market and such, this just don't manifest quite as quickly. But they also kind of on the other side, they weren't manifesting as quickly.\",\n"," 'So I would call it a little less impactful at this point and juncture, but the key point that I think we focused on is, these have been multiyear conversations and relationship builds for us as we move into these, and typically not a 6-month process.',\n"," 'Yes. Thanks for the question, A.J., and I appreciate that lead in, Andrew. Most of these conversations have been around innovation and how do we continue to drive value-based solutions in the form of product design. That has really been the central theme throughout.',\n"," 'We have showed up to the market with some new ideas around virtual care.',\n"," \"You've heard about that with our partnership with Optum, both in terms of product design, as well as broader access beyond medical integrated with behavioral, et cetera, and how we really enable the consumer. High deductibles have often have been a part of the equation for a long time, but Bind really puts that consumer in the driver's seat where they're able to choose what coverage they want with pre-service guaranteed costs. And that really resonates in the marketplace. And most importantly, for employers, it not only provides great quality, but lower price points.\",\n"," 'So I would say the conversations have been less around staffing and employment levels and more around value. And these examples of products have really resonated.',\n"," \"Yes, John, I think you summarized that well. I might just add on inflation. Obviously, as you well know, Justin, we priced to our forward view of cost, that includes inflation. We're certainly respectful of what we're seeing in terms of labor cost with our provider partners. And as you might expect, obviously, with long-term agreements, there will be more impact in 2023 than 2022, just as a function of time and how we renew these contracts.\",\n"," 'So certainly respectful of that dynamic and environment. Thanks.',\n"," \"Sure. Thanks for that, Andrew. Maybe to put it in 2 zones. Macro, I think Andrew hit it right in that macro environment. It's really around virtual care and around emergency department use. We've seen, obviously, virtual care increase and emergency department use go down.\",\n"," \"As I think in the particular, again, back to that concept of consumer and choice, it's around product design, Bind being our best example when we can put that consumer in the driver's seat where they can choose site of service and optimize both their cost and quality, they do. And when you couple that with a high-performing network, obviously, you get the benefit both of the unit cost as well as that consumer choice.\",\n"," 'So those are the greatest examples that I can see really emerging in this environment.',\n"," \"So as Andrew said, really strong growth this year, and you see that as a result of new client growth and the membership that we've brought in and the direct Optum Rx as well as the UnitedHealthcare book. And you're seeing that in the revenue, you're seeing that in the scripts volume, we see strong utilization, and you also we're seeing that in the earnings growth. With respect to investments, which do impact margins in the quarter, but we will see a return on those through the year and in our long-term plan, I point you to actually 4 things. Number one, those client investments that Andrew talked about. Number two, we talked to you about the new businesses. We've referenced Genoa that we continue to expand into new sites so we can serve more individuals in underserved communities. But I'd maybe point you to 2 additional ones that I think provide some great context where we're investing for the year. That's, number one, with our existing clients and even being responsive to those or prospective clients in our PBM, it's moving very urgently with innovation, like Brian's seeing on the UnitedHealthcare side. To develop products today that address specialty drug costs that are high and rising in addition to consumer affordability. Building on the tools that we've already, I think, delivered significant value.\",\n"," \"Our specialty tools has delivered over $1 billion of value over the last 2.5 years, and we're not done. We're working urgently to bring more services and products.\",\n"," \"So that's happening real time in the quarter, and those investments will pay off. And then the last one I'd point you to are those -- are our pharmacies.\",\n"," \"So our pharmacies are fast growing. We're seeing that impacting our top line growth and in our earnings. But you'll see us not just invest in our operations, and we've talked to you about that before, and in our digital experience. But I'm most excited about the fact that we're also integrating the service.\",\n"," 'So putting the pharmacist first.',\n"," 'We have over 7,000 pharmacists that work hard every day not just to serve and sync meds, but to help our individuals navigate, educate and guide people through our best-in-class capabilities.',\n"," \"And so really, integrating those pharmacies with the pharmacist-first and a service-first model is one of our biggest investments in the quarter, and you're going to see a return on that through the rest of the year, but I think it's also going to pay off in the growth of those pharmacies and better service to individuals that need us most.\",\n"," \"As Andrew said, strong selling season across Optum Rx is enjoying that as well. And the way I think about that, first of all, it came off a really strong '22 season. Sitting where we are today, 2 ways to think about it.\",\n"," \"The first is client retention. We're going to be in the high 90s again this year with most of the book in right now. With respect to new business activity, based on sales activity, including finalists and win rates right now, we're ahead of where we were at this time last year. And I really think that's the result of the real-time innovation. We're working again with our clients now to bring them services today. We're not waiting. We're not waiting for other market factors or the environment to make us innovate and drive down cost, and that's showing up.\",\n"," \"I think we have the best client management team and responsive client management team in the industry, and that's paying off for us.\",\n"," \"So I think we're going to be very busy again in 2023. That's going to require some investment. But we're going to be very busy with another 2023 year serving our clients. With respect to value based, I guess, I think about it in 2 respects. We're seeing better -- we're seeing definitely more interest and pressure from our clients. And we're also seeing more engagement from our clients to engage in the elements of value-based care and to incorporate pharmacy, including specialty pharmacy, into those constructs. The role for us to play is, number one, to ensure that our pharma partners are bringing the most affordable value-based and clinically appropriate drugs to drive those results. But the other thing is that we bring tools real time that integrate products, with treatment protocols. We work very closely with Optum Health, and particularly with most -- with many of our Optum Care prescribers and providers, to experiment with these tools and services that will help prescribers make the right choices.\",\n"," 'Our plans and plan sponsors to be able to have more predictability in their services and for us, to be an important piece of that value-based shift.',\n"," \"So you'll continue to see us invest there, and I think we'll see even more -- the PBMs being a bigger piece of driving value-based care and integrating pharmacy.\",\n"," 'Hey, good morning, Josh. [Audio Gap] selling season for Medicare Advantage. Throughout the selling season [Audio Gap] number and also seeing, as John talked about, really great engagement.',\n"," \"I think about senior market [Audio Gap] continuous agenda of innovation is super important [Audio Gap] Dirk talked about the UCARD, which is something that makes our benefits easier to use, more simple for members to understand on and experience. But beyond that, we'll continue to bring forth consistent innovations that make the member experience easier for people. Things like the digital experience, more personalized member experiences as well.\",\n"," \"I think another theme for the senior population will continue to be to -- on expand at-home services. That's really important.\",\n"," \"I think we've historically thought of the center of care for seniors to be in the physician's office. More and more, though, that's becoming something that needs to occur out of the home given mobility channels, challenges for folks, the vulnerability of this population, bringing care into the home is absolutely essential to the delivery of high-quality care.\",\n"," 'So those are the big themes.',\n"," 'For me, looking forward is continue to advance the at-home capabilities for seniors and continue to innovate, make using benefits easier, more understandable, simple, affordable.',\n"," 'Yes. Kevin, thanks for the question. Absolutely, we are seeing continued growth of our physicians in Optum Health and Optum Care. What we’ve found is that physicians are increasingly attracted to the value proposition that we offer them, which is less clerical burden and more focused on doing the work that they love, which is providing clinical care.',\n"," 'Moving physicians to value-based care paradigms is especially appealing.',\n"," \"So you're seeing us appeal to large groups like Atrius and Kelsey that have recently joined Optum Health, as well as doctors coming straight out of residency.\",\n"," \"So we're tracking nicely towards our growth agenda of adding 10,000 physicians and advanced practitioners during the year, and look forward to following up with you at the investor conference to share those numbers.\"]"]},"execution_count":8,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["string_all_data_doc"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":93,"status":"ok","timestamp":1667285975232,"user":{"displayName":"Ishan
